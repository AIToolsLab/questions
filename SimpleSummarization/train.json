{"prompt":"I really like kayaking. It's nice to go out on a river all by myself and just feel the nature around me. It's good exercise, too, because you're always swinging your arms, trying to get the kayak to move the way you want against the currents. Sometimes, it gets too hard, so you have to rest a bit and just let the flow take you where it will.","completion":"Where do you like to go kayaking?"}
{"prompt":"I worked at NASA-Langley for a year after I graduated with my masters. It really isn't like industry though. It's an academic environment. It's a very research-oriented environment. I also received an educational grant about a year ago to work the summer at Boeing. I worked in Philadelphia with the rotorcraft division. They make all levels of military aircraft. They make the Belle Boeing 609, which is a lot like a V-22. It takes off like a helicopter, straight up, and then the wings turn over and it flies. They also work on CH-47, which is a very old helicopter, in a support mode. They also do some work with the commanche attack helicopter. As you can tell, they work at a lot of different levels in the design.","completion":"What is the difference between designing for a new product versus an older product?"}
{"prompt":"Number 1 is the technical skills. You've got to have those. Next are communication and teamwork skills. There is a need for intangibles to be successful. One of the big things at Boeing was timing. They had to pull together over 1,000,000 parts to make the 777. The engine had to come in at the right time to be connected to the fuselage, which had to be connected to other parts. I realized that what Boeing was doing was just a large-scale integration project. It requires a phenomenal amount of communication and scheduling. Being able to plan and schedule things is so important. You're always behind time, over budget, and have to get deliverables to the customer. You have to make a decision with incomplete information. It's a lot of gut feel and just making your best engineering judgement and taking your best shot.","completion":"What are the worst skills, or characteristics, for an engineer to have?"}
{"prompt":"A typical day varies radically for mechanical engineers depending on the job you have. A guy doing research is more independent, a guy doing customer service is dealing with people all day long, while a manager deals mainly with projects. It can really vary depending on what you want to do.","completion":"What can a person do to improve their situation?"}
{"prompt":"Music has been something that I was always fascinated by already as a kid. Technically, I would suppose I started by learning the trumpet at the age of nine, forcefully somewhat. And I didn’t like it, but I always appreciated how music was put together. So, I spent than just a lot of time doing research and experimentation and just finding my way. It was kind of a passion that it got me deeper and deeper into it, just by chance. So, yeah that’s kind of the start of that.","completion":"And did you consider yourself a musician in the beginning or was it just an organic slow process of becoming one?"}
