{"prompt": " I think it's changed somewhat. I think the leadership, for example, the executive positions in the council, the officers are from countries that have good human rights records and have better democratic credentials. And I think it's probably a good idea that we come back and work from within.", "completion": " The Obama administration is clearly engaging with the U.N. in a much more serious way than the Bush administration did. Do you think that's a better approach?"}
{"prompt": " Well, I think that in the Bush administration there was perhaps, amongst - in some quarters, at least, not sufficient appreciation of the great value that the United Nations can be to U.S. interests. I particularly would cite peacekeeping; the role that U.N. peacekeeping operations played in Sierra Leone or in Liberia, for example, was really remarkable, helped restore order to very desperate situations. And if you want to look at it from a financial point of view, it cost us 26 cents on the dollar, in the sense that that's our assessment for peacekeeping operations and we didn't have to send U.S. troops. So sometimes I think Americans tend to underappreciate what it is that the United Nations can do to help advance our foreign policy and national security interests.", "completion": " Going back to the Human Rights Council for a moment, just this past week, the council just barely passed a resolution to keep human rights monitors in Darfur. And it's already withdrawn human rights monitors from places like Cuba and Belarus. Can the council really be taken seriously if, as some have argued, many of its decisions are simply political?"}
{"prompt": " Well, yeah, that - and what you just mentioned is disappointing. But they do have mandates for other countries of human rights interests, whether it's Somalia or Burundi or Myanmar. And I think we just have to keep making the case and working with others.", "completion": " But what can the United States do now that it has a seat on the council in terms of making it a more even-handed body?"}
{"prompt": " Good to be here.", "completion": " What do you have to do to make the EPA's most wanted list?"}
{"prompt": " Well, you have to be charged with an environmental crime by the Department of Justice or a companion state law enforcement prosecutor and decide that you don't want to face those charges. And after charging, you escape. You leave. You go on the lam. And the majority of these folks did not show up to court to address their charges. And one of them was - went on the lam after her conviction occurred.", "completion": " Now there are about 20 people on this list?"}
{"prompt": " They have.", "completion": " Like Greece and Ireland, for example, several countries with which the U.S. has extradition treaties. So why can't you just ask some of these countries to send them back here?"}
{"prompt": " Absolutely. Our agents in the Criminal Investigation Division within the criminal program are all authorized to carry weapons, execute search warrants. They have full law enforcement powers that you'd expect from someone with the Secret Service or the Marshals Service. The same techniques that we use to build a criminal case against one of the individuals on this list or one of our other cases are the same techniques that the FBI or the Secret Service might use in a credit card case. You're out there putting puzzles together, protecting human health, and the environment, and bringing bad guys to justice.", "completion": " Now, there are some crimes in here that you wouldn't think would maybe land somebody on a Most Wanted List, a government agency's Most Wanted List. I, for example, I noticed that the Giordano brothers, charged with importing and distributing cars that didn't meet U.S. emissions standards. That's a federal offense?"}
{"prompt": " Well, we don't have a top per se. These are all our fugitives. Certainly the one that has gotten some significant notoriety recently is Albania Deleon out of Massachusetts, the first woman on the list, who went on the lam after being convicted at trial and was facing a lengthy prison sentence...", "completion": " What did she do?"}
{"prompt": " Well thank you very much for having me.", "completion": " Now we just heard from a supporter of Mousavi in Tehran. He was saying that he's been paying particular attention to the slogans, the chants that he is hearing from people out on the street. What's your sense? Is there an effort by Mousavi supporters to appropriate the symbols, including the chants from the 1979 Revolution?"}
{"prompt": " I think it's a very symbolic process. It has been a symbolic process from the beginning. When in just two days ago, Mousavi invited his supporters to demonstrate between Inquilab Square to Azadi Square. I think that was when symbolism really reached an unexpected height. Because as, you know, Tehran University gates are located just next to Inquilab Square. And Inquilab in Persian, means the revolution. And basically, marching from the Revolution Square to Azadi Square, which means freedom. So by asking his supporters, who showed up in hundreds of thousands to participate in that march, I think Mousavi proved that he is a master of image and metaphor.", "completion": " Well, speaking of images, I want to ask you something else about the crowds. We've noticed that there have been several people who seemed to be holding signs that are written in English. Despite the effort to quash the coverage of the demonstrations from the western press, it seems that they're trying to send messages of some kind. What do you make of that?"}
{"prompt": " There would be a vote in the committee to enforce the subpoenas and hold the witness or witnesses in contempt. That would then go to the full House for consideration on the floor and a vote. A simple majority vote would be required to approve those resolutions. And from there, assuming they are approved, they would be certified to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia for prosecution.", "completion": " So it ends up in the court, so to speak, of the U.S. attorney?"}
{"prompt": " Well, it may or may not, because as you know, the U.S. attorney is an appointee of the executive branch. The last time this happened, when I was counsel to the House of Representatives in 1983, the U.S. attorney refused to present them to a grand jury. And instead he sued the House of Representatives, alleging that the subpoenas themselves were illegal.", "completion": " But isn't what a lot of this about is that the U.S. attorney is supposed to be insulated somewhat from partisan politics?"}
{"prompt": " Well, a vote by the House to vindicate its subpoena power is hardly a political matter; it's a judicial matter. The question here is one of separation of powers. How does the Congress get its subpoenas enforced against executive branch officials? There's no easy answer to that, because we live in a system where the branches are independent of one another. And so the Congress would have to find someone with the constitutional authority and willingness to prosecute someone for contempt. That person may not be the United States attorney.", "completion": " Okay. Just following this along: if the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia were to get these subpoenas, and effectively asked to enforce them against top White House aides, and refused, where would it go then?"}
{"prompt": " It would go nowhere, because there is no other enforcement mechanism. The other enforcement mechanism available to the Congress, which it has used historically, is to arrest the contemptuous witness and bring them before the House to enforce the subpoenas in the well of the House. That hasn't happened in the last 75 or 80 years. And so it's highly unlikely that Congress would pursue that remedy.", "completion": " If the White House and Congress do go back to the negotiating table, where is their room for compromise?"}
{"prompt": " First, I don't know how critical it is for these people to be under oath, and that seems to be a sticking point for the administration. I think for the House or the Senate, the need for a transcript of this testimony is key for them, and that's because they have heard a variety of responses to the reasons for these firings and they want to compare that testimony with other people who have testified.", "completion": " From what you know so far, does it look to you like anyone has done anything illegal?"}
{"prompt": " The U.N. right now is the central arena where you're trying to fashion an international consensus against Iran so that it does not continue with its uranium enrichment program, which could one day turn into a nuclear weapons program. I would think that's issue number one. After that, you would have such issues as stopping the genocide in Darfur in western Sudan. You would have also keeping the pressure on the situation in Lebanon and seeing that legal and political inquiry continues, and that the Syrians are not led off for what they, clearly, were or had orchestrated in the assassination of the former prime minister there.", "completion": " Given that Ambassador Bolton was a notorious critic of the U.N. and perceived as confrontational, what kind of environment will Khalilzad find himself stepping into at the U.N.?"}
{"prompt": " Well, I think there is some damage that needs to be repaired. But on the other hand, he also, therefore, gets a tremendous boost. He's a fresh face. He is someone who comes with a good reputation from his experiences in both Iraq and Afghanistan. So I think, to borrow from Woody Allen, to the extent that 90 percent of life is showing up, he realizes a bit of progress and a bit of improvement simply by showing up and not having all that baggage with them.", "completion": " Is there anybody that Zalmay Khalilzad could be compared to, historically, that is to say, on the level of influence that that person has?"}
{"prompt": " I would put it a different way. There's two types, traditionally, of U.S. ambassadors to the U.N. One type is those who come to New York, who comes to U.N., and use it something as a podium, and they use it as a way to speak to the world from the position of the Untied States. And John Bolton was very much in that category. A second type of ambassador to the U.N - and I would put Ambassador Khalilzad much more on this camp - is more of an insider, more working within the U.N. rather than fighting against it.", "completion": " Then how much influence can a U.S. ambassador to the U.N. actually have - because it does seem that matters of great importance are handled directly by the secretary of state and her top advisers?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning, Renee.", "completion": " Would you say that Al Gore - given all of his history with this subject - is a credible voice on global climate change?"}
{"prompt": " Indeed. And he implies, essentially - he never says - but he implies that Katrina is due to human-induced global warming. And I think if a scientist were to talk about this, most scientists say these are the kinds of things that we expect to see more of as a result of global warming. But people are careful not to attribute specific storms or events to global warming. Again, Gore doesn't do that exactly, but he sort of leaves the impression. And it's a very lawyerly way he does this. He doesn't - if you actually read it word for word, you can't say, this he said wrong. But he leaves the impression that Katrina was global warming, and I think scientists don't go that far.", "completion": " So is this partly cultural in the sense that scientists do, by nature and by profession, care about all of the details?"}
{"prompt": " I think it's partly cultural. And I think that in that sense, Al Gore is very well attuned to the culture of Washington, D.C. And the culture of Washington, D.C. is don't do anything unless there is a crisis. And that's been the problem with global warming for all these years, is that it's something serious to be worried about - the worst-case scenarios are pretty scary. But Al Gore has realized that if you want to get attention, you really have to focus on the crisis, and you have to make people worry about things maybe a little bit more than scientists would say.", "completion": " Is there some element of - if you will - professional jealousy here?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning.", "completion": " Could you give us just a brief history of why Musharraf suspended this chief justice?"}
{"prompt": " The allegation is that he had abused his power and had engaged in misconduct. But the real reason behind it, many people believe, is that he was a thorn in the side of the administration and may have caused problems for Musharraf's reelection bid later this year.", "completion": " And in what way was he a thorn, as you say in the side of this administration?"}
{"prompt": " He is very outspoken. He's aired the regime's dirty laundry in public by chiding the government, particularly in a case where many terrorism suspects have been disappeared by the intelligence agencies. So he sort of forced the government to trace these people, which the regime didn't like. And he may question the constitutional grounds of Musharraf running for reelection later this year.", "completion": " Is there, in fact, a case for this chief justice being compromised?"}
{"prompt": " People are saying this is the biggest political debacle of his tenure. It remains to be seen how serious it will become. Right now, it seems serious because as you pointed out, hundreds of lawyers are on the street. This is not a mass movement by political parties. It's citizens; it's intellectuals; it's people who are protesting regardless of their party affiliation. If the political parties decide to join in, it could snowball into a mass movement. And then Musharraf could really be in trouble.", "completion": " And what for Musharraf would constitute being in trouble?"}
{"prompt": " Well, again he is up for reelection at the end of this year. I mean this is a national drama that is being played out on television. And the people and the court of public opinion, Musharraf is definitely losing points. When he goes to the polls at the end of the year, he's likely to have few friends, particularly after this incident. And so what might happen, it might force him to be even more heavy handed and, you know, some people are saying postpone the elections.", "completion": " And where would you say this is all headed?"}
{"prompt": " Thank you.", "completion": " David Montero is a reporter with The Christian Science Monitor speaking from Islamabad. This is NPR News. To help us make sense of all this, we turn now to Adam Davidson. He's a member of our Planet Money team. And Adam, this is big complicated stuff. So today we're going to try to take just one central piece of this and try to understand it, this Consumer Financial Protection Agency. We heard about this from Scott Horsley. But could you tell us a little bit more about why the administration has seen fit to create this new agency?"}
{"prompt": " Well it's really interesting in the big white paper that the administration released today. They say that consumer financial products -we're talking about mortgages, credit cards, basically the stuff we get from banks and other financial services companies - have been regulated - in fact, have been regulated by many different regulators - but that we've learned that there were gaps, there were things that regulators weren't paying attention to. And obviously lots and lots of Americans got mortgages that they didn't fully understand, mortgages that probably any reasonable financial advisor or someone looking at this objectively would say, boy, may be no one should have ever gotten an interest-only-balloon-option-arm mortgage. So this new agency would look at this, and, I guess sort of modeled on something like the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which says hey, you can't sell a toaster that burns down a house - would say you can't sell a mortgage that makes someone lose their house.", "completion": " So this all sounds wonderful but how will this work?"}
{"prompt": " Well that's the issue. Will it work at all? What the administration's own white paper shows is that these are not new powers. The government and a variety of regulators have had the power to make sure that the products that banks and other financial services companies sell to us are good and sound and reasonable. And for a variety of reasons, they clearly have fallen down on the job. And so creating a new agency, sure it's easy to imagine that for the first few years, or our first while, they will pay very close attention to more exotic financial products. But it's pretty easy, and a lot of the people I talked to today say 10 years from now, 30 years from now, 50 years from now, is this really setting in place a fundamental change, or is this just one more layer of regulation in a regulatory system that fundamentally broke down? Objection number two actually comes from small banks. They say that this works to benefit the large banks that caused this crisis. And by imposing a huge burden on small banks, it actually penalizes the very banking institutions that weren't selling junk that defrauded customers.", "completion": " So if the Consumer Financial Protection Agency lives up to its name and tries to protect consumers, what is an example of a burden? I guess that's what they call it that this new agency would impose on one of those small banks that's so worried about the new system?"}
{"prompt": " The small banks say that this new system imposes huge regulations on them that will, for example, force them to hire more lawyers. If your entire profits are $300,000, you can't hire too many more lawyers before you run out of money. Whereas the large banks can spread the costs of this new regulation much more easily. So it penalizes the part of our system, this is the argument, that was the most stable and it effectively rewards the part of our system that was the most unstable.", "completion": " And if it does that then it's the larger banks that would be more likely to survive. And wasn't that one of the lessons of the financial crisis, that big banks can sometimes - or big institutions - can sometimes, cause the biggest problems?"}
{"prompt": " Good afternoon, Robert.", "completion": " You were one of the stakeholders who met with President Obama at the White House last month and pledged, I thought, to take steps to save the nation more than two trillion dollars in health care spending over the next 10 years. Since then, the Obama administration has called for cuts of a couple of hundred billion dollars in hospital reimbursements. You've expressed disappointment and concern. Can hospitals reduce spending or not?"}
{"prompt": " Correct, yes.", "completion": " But we could think about those things - and it might take decades to change a national culture regarding wellness, and when we see the doctor and for what purpose. In the meantime, we're spending $2.3 trillion a year on health care reform. Can the hospitals cut spending soon?"}
{"prompt": " I think all stakeholders have to examine what they can do now. So, very definitely, hospitals already are working hard at improving quality and the related costs. That's been going on now for several years and we want to see that not only continue but pick up in pace.", "completion": " Let me ask you about what Peter Orszag, the OMB Director, said which is that, it would be a double payment to your member hospitals to both reduce the number of the uninsured and also maintain the current level of reimbursement. That is, if fewer uninsured patients are turning up at your member hospitals because there's been a new system of health insurance offered them, why shouldn't Washington reduce reimbursements?"}
{"prompt": " It's for hospitals that see a disproportionately high share of uninsured or Medicaid beneficiaries. Now, certainly, if people were to have coverage tomorrow, everybody today who's not covered, you could make the case for those dollars going away. But how soon will that coverage kick in? At what payment levels, across what proportion of the uninsured population? Even by the best estimates, right now, people are saying that it looks like some of the plans that are out there could cover maybe a third, maybe at the high end, two-thirds of the population. That still leaves a lot of people uncovered. It still leaves a lot of people on the Medicaid program, and it still leaves a lot people who are undocumented immigrants, and so on. So that need isn't going to go away over night.", "completion": " But let's say, of the roughly whatever it is, 45-48 million uninsured people that - let's assume success, that two-thirds of them do, indeed, become insured over a period of years. Would the hospitals, would your member hospitals accept, in principle, the idea that reimbursements from Washington should conversely decline as the number of insured patients rises at those very institutions?"}
{"prompt": " Yes. We have accepted that, in principle. We understand that that would be a definite improvement over the current system of so many Americans not having health insurance. But the question is: By when? At what level of coverage, across what proportion of the population?", "completion": " You spoke of the commitments that you did make at the White House when you talked about controlling increases in health care spending. What are those commitments? What are the hospitals going to do?"}
{"prompt": " Right.", "completion": " that are already underway. But they haven't already been reflected in a slower rate of increase in hospital costs, have they?"}
{"prompt": " Right.", "completion": " I found that with the names Bill and James, Bill James is actually a big-deal baseball statistician - but when I put in Henry James, William James or Harry James, those all popped up with the dates of birth and death of Henry James, William James and the old bandleader, Harry James. Is the contribution of the philosophical pragmatist and the Anglophile American novelist - is what they've done ultimately quantifiable, or do you have wisdom and information that simply will not lend itself to any kind of computing, if you want to know about it?"}
{"prompt": " Thanks for having me.", "completion": " What stood out to you in the Netanyahu speech today?"}
{"prompt": " I think what stood out is that very little stood out. This was a speech that was not intended to break new ground. It was a speech that I think could be billed as the placeholder speech, the speech that was intended to get Netanyahu out of the dilemma he faced: pressure from the U.S. on the one hand and the realities of his right-wing coalition on the other; and that was his goal was to survive this and to be able to live another day.", "completion": " Now, he talked about a Palestinian state that would be de-militarized, that wouldn't have control over its air space, for example. Are these things that Palestinians could realistically swallow?"}
{"prompt": " Hard to say, but in many ways, these are traditional Israeli positions, which is why this debate about Palestinian state had always seemed to me to be a false debate because some Israelis say they accept the Palestinian state, and then they tag on all these conditions, which make it very hard for the Palestinians to accept. And others, like Netanyahu until recently, rejected Palestinian statehood because he said those conditions would violate a basic principle of statehood. What he's done today is say okay, I accept statehood, but here's a list of conditions; and if the Palestinians accept them, we can go ahead, but as you suggest, it is going to be very difficult for the two sides to agree.", "completion": " Robert Malley, he was speaking - Mr. Netanyahu was speaking in front of a primarily right-of-center audience at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, sort of the intellectual home of the pro-settler camp. So within that context, can his speech be considered somewhat risky politically at all?"}
{"prompt": " Not really. I think most Israelis, including those he was speaking to, had come to understand that he couldn't stick to his position on the two things that President Obama had asked: statehood and a settlement freeze. What he says is statehood but, and a settlement freeze with exceptions. That was his way to balance between the two demands, and I suspect that the people in the audience, and more broadly in Israel, including his right-wing coalition partners, knew that that was where he would have to end up, even though it may give them some heartburn.", "completion": " Is there a sense among both Israelis and Palestinians that you speak with on a regular basis of an imminent change in tone if not policy coming out of Washington?"}
{"prompt": " Well, I think they're already seeing it. And I think the real question, what we see now are just the preliminaries. We've seen the first moves in a very long chess game, and the fight has been about these two things: statehood and settlement freeze, but that's not really what the issue is. The issue is going to be when the two sides are at the table, can they reach an agreement? Can they agree on what the borders will be? Once you agree where the borders are, it doesn't matter; you don't talk about a settlement freeze anymore. You speak about evacuating those settlements that will be in Palestinian hands, and you will be continuing to build as much as you want on those settlements that will be annexed by Israel. And the real questions now are when those two parties, when they start negotiating, can they reach an agreement? The answer is likely to be no; and at that point, what does the U.S. do?", "completion": " Well, it's a question. A few weeks ago, we spoke with Aaron David Miller who, of course you know, worked on Palestinian-Israeli negotiations at the State Department under President Clinton. He said it's pretty much impossible for any U.S. administration to impose a peace settlement. Would you agree with that?"}
{"prompt": " Hello.", "completion": " Where were you in life when you wrote \"The Virgin Suicides\"? What was going on?"}
{"prompt": " I was working at the Academy of American Poets as an executive secretary and earning a very small salary and living out in distant Brooklyn. And I, you know, I decided to become a writer when I was fairly young, 16, 17 years old. And by this time, I was almost 30 with only one publication to my name. So, I was in a state of increasing anxiety as I began to get older with nothing to show for myself and began writing \"The Virgin Suicides\" some time in that period. And I had started other novels before, but for some reason, this one was the one I was able to finish.", "completion": " How long did it take you to write?"}
{"prompt": " If I can inject a note of optimism, which is what Detroiters always do in the midst of gloom, the flag of Detroit -Detroit burned down in the 1800s, and the motto on the flag says it will rise again from the ashes. We will see better days. And I was recently back in Detroit on the day that Chrysler went into bankruptcy, and of course, things are terrible there, everyone knows about that. But I was surprised downtown to see how much life there was at night. A lot of the abandoned buildings, and I'm talking about skyscrapers, sometimes 16-floor buildings are empty. They're being rented out, the lobbies, and techno parties are being thrown in them. And these parties move around from place to place, and it reminded me of Berlin in the early '90s. So, there is some kind of life pulsating in Detroit still, and I was gratified to see that.", "completion": " And Berlin had the benefit of once again becoming the capital of Germany and receiving federal subsidies. And Detroit's in a very different position. Do you think Detroit will be a major city in 20, 30, 40 years?"}
{"prompt": " Thanks for having me.", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Guy Raz. In Iran's capital, Tehran, protestors and police have clashed throughout the day after the official results from yesterday's presidential election were announced. Supporters of defeated presidential candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, say the vote was rigged, that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's lopsided margin of victory over his reform-minded rivals just doesn't make sense. For weeks, tens of thousands of people rallied against the incumbent and most pre-election polls showed a far tighter race. NPR's Mike Shuster is a veteran Iran watcher and he's on the line from Tehran. Mike, what have you been seeing on the streets of the city today?"}
{"prompt": " There were serious clashes between pro Mousavi protestors and the police, particularly after the government made the official announcement in the middle of the afternoon that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had been reelected. At that point, people began to pour into the street in many spots in Central Tehran and sort of pull themselves together in formal and spontaneous protest. I'm staying at a hotel on Vali-Ye-Asr Street, which runs from North Tehran to South Tehran. And in the center of the city, there were numerous demonstrations on Vali-Ye-Asr Street. And then, what happened is the protestors tied up the traffic and the government ordered in the riot police. And they sent in dozens of riot police on motorcycles, clad in a lot of body armor, carrying truncheons and baton started beating people. And the beatings got quite serious. The protestors fought back. They burnt trash cans in the streets. But eventually, by the end of the afternoon, for the most part, the riot police had regained control of the street.", "completion": " Now, Mike, the official margin of victory was huge, almost 30 percentage points. Ahmadinejad called the elections free and fair. I mean, is there any evidence for the claims made by his opponents that there were irregularities?"}
{"prompt": " No, there's no evidence yet. Mousavi himself released a statement saying that there had been mass irregularities and calling for an investigation. The official results have Ahmadinejad beating Mousavi two to one. If it had been much closer, if Ahmadinejad had beaten him 52 to 48 or 53 to 47, there might be many people who doubt the results now who would have been convinced. But it seems an enormous gap, one that was incredible to many, many people, and they have a hard time accepting it.", "completion": " What about some reports we're hearing that the country's cell phone and Internet system have been shut down?"}
{"prompt": " They are down. The Internet system is down. I can't tell how widespread it is where I am. The Internet system is down. The cell phone system is down. The text message system has been down for a couple of days. That seems to have been taken down because the Mousavi campaign was using it to communicate with millions of people very quickly and call them into the streets or announce rallies or demonstration.", "completion": " I understand that some 40 million paper ballots were cast. These are all presumably hand counted. How did election officials manage to get a result so fast after the polls closed?"}
{"prompt": " I think that's a good question and one of the suspicions of many people. The Interior Ministry, which organized the election, said that it would take a full 24 hours to get a count from when the polls closed late on Friday night. But almost immediately, after midnight last night, there were results. And by the time everybody woke up this morning, many, many votes were said to have been counted and Ahmadinejad already had a two-to-one lead over Mousavi. It wasn't computerized. These were all paper ballots and they where marked by hand.", "completion": " And Mike, in the few moments we have remaining, you've been making -reporting trips to Iran for many, many years now. And I'm wondering if the reaction of Iranians to this election seems different to you? Do people feel increasingly comfortable criticizing the government, for example?"}
