{"prompt": " Right. It's been a boom; a bonanza of sales of Michael Jackson records, of Michael Jackson memorabilia, anything people can get their hands on. Now there's a hint today that there may be a film of some kind which would be based on the videotapes of the rehearsals for the \"This Is It\" concert. It's like people look back and they say that Elvis was a richer man in death than he was in life, and Michael Jackson may be the same story.", "completion": " Michael Jackson, of course, had three children; one of them with a surrogate mother. What happens to those kids?"}
{"prompt": " That's right.", "completion": " Is there any precedent around the world? Do we know if this will actually work?"}
{"prompt": " Yeah. We have our cap and trade system ourselves for sulfur dioxide to control acid rain, and it's worked beautifully. The cost of reducing the acid rain pollution has been much less than was expected. We have tradable permit systems for fishing where there 's, you know, limited resources of fish and they worked very well; so, now, this is actually a well-tested form. Well, nobody has ever done that's done it on this scale.", "completion": " And the goal is to cut greenhouse gases over the next decade by about 17 percent below where it was in 2005, 83 percent by the middle of the century. How is this all going to affect the U.S. economy?"}
{"prompt": " Most of the estimates say less than you would imagine because the U.S. economy is a wonderfully flexible, innovative thing and it can adjust to changes and incentives, so all of this is going to lead to probably a little bit less purchasing power than we would otherwise have. Congressional Budget Office says about $175 for the typical household by 10 years from now in losses, about the equivalent of a postage stamp a day, but in return for that, greatly reducing the chance of catastrophic climate change, reducing all of the negatives that come with it.", "completion": " Now it was a close vote in the House last night, 219 to 212. In fact, a lot of Democrats voted against it, 44 of them. Why is that?"}
{"prompt": " Oh yeah. It's not cost-free. There are very few good things that are completely without costs. And it's entirely understandable that some people would prefer not to face those and some interest groups that give a lot of campaign contributions will be hurt by this. So opposition isn't surprising. The miracle is that the thing passed anyway.", "completion": " Paul Krugman, explain this to me. I heard Congressman Henry Waxman, who pushed through this bill, argue that it will actually create jobs. How will it do that?"}
{"prompt": " Well, it's going to mean a lot of jobs in all kinds of industries that one way or another contribute to conservation.", "completion": " Like which ones?"}
{"prompt": " There will be more wind farms built. There'll be people retrofitting power plants to reduce their emissions. There will be people weatherproofing housing and commercial buildings. One economist would say is that employment will probably be just about the same as it would've been otherwise. But it'll be somewhat different mixes of jobs. And the main thing is that the cost to American households is going to be really minimal, and we might just save the planet along the way.", "completion": " You willing to bet your Nobel Prize on that?"}
{"prompt": " I feel it's my time.", "completion": " How do you know?"}
{"prompt": " It is. It is a divorce. For such a long time, I felt actually guilty to feel this way, like I've been cheating, so to speak, in my marriage. But I really have lived this career in many ways to the fullest. So, I feel peaceful about that.", "completion": " Talk to me about persevering in the ballet. You were born with scoliosis, right?"}

{"prompt": " Yeah.", "completion": " What if you regret it?"}
{"prompt": " Tough.", "completion": " Is there a chance that you might?"}

People know about colony collapse disorder with honeybees, but they don't realize that at least four species of our native bumblebees - those big, black and yellow charismatic bees - that pollinate a lot of important crops. They have been declining.", "completion": " Well, we said you're trying to spread the message broadly. What is the message you're trying to get out there?"}
{"prompt": " Yes. We're really excited about that local beekeeper and I believe some USDA bees that are disease resistant bees. We're hoping that the garden that Michelle Obama has planted will help make pollinators known - the plight of pollinators, certainly their decline. So there are certain things we can all do, pollinator friendly practices in our own homes and gardens that will really help conserve pollinators around the country.", "completion": " What would some of those things be for the backyard gardeners DR.

It's now.", "completion": " Dr. Jerri Nielson Fitzgerald died yesterday from breast cancer. She was 57. Pollster Stanley Greenberg is having a disturbing sense of deja vu. The issue is health care. Greenberg was a pollster for the Clinton White House. He surveyed public opinion on health care reform back in the early 90s before the Clinton plan went down in flames. Now Greenberg has gone back to the public for a new round of independent research, asking the same questions he asked some 15 years ago. And he joins us in the studio to talk about what he's found. Stan Greenberg, you write in The New Republic that your head is throbbing. Why is your head throbbing?"}
{"prompt": " And it's still throbbing because the deja vu won't go away. Health care reform is the hardest thing to do. And it's painful because the country is desperate for it to happen. People know they want this change. But they know that, you know, if it's not done right, they pay a price. Therefore, you know, the president and the administration has to make its case in a special way that, one, reassures them, but also tells them it's the right kind of change.", "completion": " Well, what were some of the questions you were asking where you found that the answers you are getting were virtually identical to what you'd found 15 years ago?"}
{"prompt": " You know, I think that's exactly right. You know, you look at the three-quarters in almost all surveys who say they want major reform and if you look at that and say: well, how can you not do this? There seems to be so much momentum. It was so central to what the president ran on - it was for President Clinton - is for President Obama. And yet, I went through each number one by one and I said, oh my God, we're in the same place.", "completion": " You know, you do hear this from the Obama administration, that things are different now, that lessons have been learned from what happened in the Clinton White House with health care reform, that there's much more unity and motivation for people to come together and that they're letting Congress take the lead, not this sort of secret, opaque procedure that happened in the Clinton years. Do you think that that's the case and then the polling that you've done, does that seem to back that up?"}
{"prompt": " Well, I think it's absolutely true. You know, up to this point, I think it's true, that is we, you know - the Clinton health care plan was devised within the White House. It never passed any committees of the - full committees of the Congress and it was a long, you know, a very long process. That's not what we are. Democrats are much more united in general, but also on health care, reform is moving. It's moving, you know, faster. It's better than the President is not mired in those, you know, specifics. But, we're also at, I think, at a different moment now. I think we've crossed the point where the public has said okay, we now want to see the details.", "completion": " Given your hard won experience in the Clinton years on health care, what do you think the lessons are that the Obama administration should be mindful of here?"}
{"prompt": " Thank you for having me.", "completion": " Stan Greenberg runs the polling and strategic consulting farm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. His article in The New Republic is called \"Repeat the Question: Why Health Care Reform Could Fail Again.\" One of America's most important friends in the Middle East chose this week to critic the war in Iraq. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah called it, quote, \"an illegitimate foreign occupation,\" which leads to the question of why the Saudis would speak out now? The statement happened in the midst of a Saudi effort to encourage peace between Israelis and Palestinians. And when we put our question to Rachel Bronson of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, she immediately saw the statement about Iraq in terms of that other conflict. Why would King Abdullah choose now to say that what the United States is doing in Iraq is illegal?"}
{"prompt": " That is right. And he - they're still talking about some sort of just solution. But, again, it's really important to go back that he - over the last few years now - he has not pushed hard for that term, and that's quite important to this discussion.", "completion": " Now, whenever a Middle Eastern government criticizes the United States, it's common for American officials to say well, they say that in public because they have to appease their public or take care of their political considerations, but privately, they tell us something else. Do you think that might be the case here?"}
{"prompt": " No, I think that what they are saying is they are very uncomfortable with American policy in Iraq. They do not", "completion": " So, we could take this is a serious statement over Iraq?"}

They were recruited into the armed forces over the objections of top generals in World War II. President Franklin Roosevelt insisted, though they remained a segregated unit and could not even train with white pilots. The African-American pilots flew, fought, we're shot down and sometimes captured or killed in Europe and North Africa and then they returned to the segregated country they had defended. Yesterday, the airmen received a congressional gold medal and a salute from President Bush. President GEORGE W.

And so on behalf of the office I hold, and a country that honors you, I salute you for the service to the United States of America. Decades after their service, the Tuskegee airmen stood and saluted back. It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Robert Mugabe heads to Tanzania today for a meeting with other African leaders in the region. Up to now, they've rarely spoken out publicly against his repressive rule. But before Mugabe became what Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Desmond Tutu has called a cartoon figure of an African dictator, he was a revered freedom fighter. To understand how Mugabe made that turn, we reached Andrew Meldrum in Johannesburg. He reported from Zimbabwe for Britain's Observer and Guardian newspapers for 23 years, until Mugabe expelled all foreign journalists in 2003. What was it that he did, perhaps in those early years, that might be called really good for Zimbabwe?"}
{"prompt": " It seemed like a very wise, statesman-like think to do. And Robert Mugabe became renowned internationally. But in fact it was something that was really in name only. As his rule continued, when his leadership was questioned, when opposition to his rule grew, he found the whites to be a very handy scapegoat.", "completion": " In those early days, wasn't Robert Mugabe also very brutal to his black opposition?"}
{"prompt": " Yes. People voted for him because he felt that he was the most ruthless of the guerrilla leaders who were fighting against Rhodesian rule. In the early years, when his party was challenged by an opposition party, Mugabe sent the fifth brigade of his army into the southern part of Zimbabwe, Matabeleland, from 1983 to 1987. It's estimated that 20,000 civilians were killed in the army's brutal campaign. So that was Robert Mugabe showing he was not afraid to use violence against anyone who would challenge his party.", "completion": " For the most part, leaders of other African countries have kept pretty quiet about what Robert Mugabe's been doing. What's that all about?"}
{"prompt": " They have kept very quiet, particularly South African President Thabo Mbeki. And that is about, I think, the solidarity that they feel. Remember, Robert Mugabe was an iconic hero who ended white minority rule. And Zimbabwe's independence helped pave the way for South Africa to overthrow apartheid. So they were loath to criticize a leader who stood at the forefront of the liberation movement. But I believe that that is coming to an end. This meeting in Tanzania with other leaders from southern Africa, they have privately already told Robert Mugabe that he must moderate his policies and that he must retire. And now that Mugabe has said that he's prepared to stand for another six-year term, which would end in 2014 when he was 90, now those African leaders are preparing to tell him in no uncertain term, Robert Mugabe, you must retire. And I think this is really a turning point in Robert Mugabe's power.", "completion": " You think he would listen at this point in time?"}
{"prompt": " Hello. Good morning.", "completion": " Now, Iran isn't saying where the Britons are being held, only that they're being questioned, right?"}
{"prompt": " That's correct. They called British ambassador yesterday that they were fit and well, and in Iran. There were no more specifics. And they also didn't agree to the British request to have access to the detainees.", "completion": " Is there a belief that Iran seized these men and one woman for use as some sort of a bargaining chip?"}
{"prompt": " Well, everything's in suggestion in some conservative circles here, conservative Web sites, that Iran should try and trade the 15 British detainees for the five Iranians being held by the U.S. in Iraq. It seems that the foreign ministry has now ruled that out.", "completion": " Okay. Then, might there be a connection to U.N. Security Council sanctions over Iran's nuclear enrichment program?"}
{"prompt": " It's still to rule out any connection with any aspect of the regional situation, including the nuclear program. But also, it's very hard to state and prove that there is any connection. I mean Iran is usually playing its cards very close to its chest, and there maybe different actors in the rather complex political scene Iran has, who are playing a rather different game. The Iranian foreign ministry seems to be taking a fairly conciliatory tone in the British, with the meetings, what the British called a businesslike tone. Whereas, the Iranian revolutionary guards, who are holding the 15 detainees, that's where people are more so, are more concerned, more angry about the detention of the Iranians in Iraq. I think we have to assume, though, that there has been some coordination on the Iranian side, probably in the Supreme National Security Council.", "completion": " Yeah. And, you know, in 2004, Iran detained another group of British marines and sailors, and they were presented on TV blindfolded. They're in Iran. They were released, ultimately, unharmed. Is it - could one might expect a similar outcome this time around?"}
{"prompt": " It's difficult now what to expect. And I talked to a couple of well-placed Iranian analysts yesterday, and they said that they still see this as a fairly low-key incident, a local incident, but they think that it could go on for another seven to 10 days before it's resolved. Now, I think that means the real question is can the British politically wait for seven to 10 days for this matter to be resolved. I think the British foreign office, and certainly the embassy here in Tehran, is saying keep calm, let's not blow this up. If we blow this up into a big incident that will convince the Iranians these people are rather more important than they really are. But at the same time, there's a lot of political pressure building up in Britain, where the media is running headlines about hostages and so on. There's a lot of political pressure on Tony Blair to do something. Now, the question then is what can the British do? What can the British do to up the ante? It seems that what they are likely to do in the coming...", "completion": " Garrett, we're - thank you. We're out of time. Thank you, Garrett Smith, reporting for the Financial Times in Tehran. It's NPR News. Rain extended the U.S. Open into an extra day of play today, and by the time it was all over, Lucas Glover - who had won just a single PGA Tour event four years ago - was the new U.S. Open champion. Needless to say, that means the other big news from Bethpage Black on Long Island was that Tiger Woods did not win the U.S. Open, nor did Phil Mickelson. Larry Dorman writes about golf for the New York Times. And Larry, who is Lucas Glover?"}
{"prompt": " Lucas Glover is a sort of prototypical United States Open Golf Championship winner. He's a very good driver of the ball. He has a very fine, iron game. He's a good putter, and he hits shots that need to be hit down the stretch in the U.S. Open. So it wasn't a surprise that he won, but it probably wasn't the most popular win with the fans. But they did embrace him afterwards.", "completion": " This was a championship that was greatly affected by weather, and it mattered if you played an early round in the morning as opposed to the afternoon, if it was wet or dry. Was it so quirky that golf writers are going to imagine a little asterisk next to Lucas Glover's name?"}
{"prompt": " Yeah. Yeah.", "completion": " Is he well, first of all? Was there any problem in terms of Woods' health?"}
{"prompt": " That's right. There's a kind of a paradox there because Zimbabwe is a failed state almost because it's too strong, because Robert Mugabe is an extreme authoritarian dictator. He's launched these ambitious land reforms years ago that have led to the current economic disaster that we see in Zimbabwe today.", "completion": " What are your criteria for determining what makes a state a failed state?"}
{"prompt": " Well, we work very closely with an NGO called the Fund for Peace here in Washington, and they have developed this methodology where they look at more than 30,000 press reports and indicators over the course of the year. And they look at 12 different factors, and they give countries a score from one to 10 in each of these 12 factors.", "completion": " What are some of the factors?"}
{"prompt": " Well, we're not saying that all of these countries are failed states. It's a failed states index, but all these countries are fragile and then they have varying states of failure. So a country like China is actually a very powerful state, but if you go outside Beijing, into the countryside, you get lots of governance problems. You have people rioting in large numbers, particularly over environmental issues. So all of these states have varying degrees of problems, and as you get toward the top of the index, toward a country like Somalia, that's when you really see outright failure.", "completion": " I mean, if this list is supposed to be a kind of a warning, right, for policy makers maybe in the United States and in the developed world, what's the prescription?"}
{"prompt": " Thanks for having me.", "completion": " Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Guy Raz. The Mexican government is sending 1,500 more troops into Ciudad Juarez. Tomorrow, those soldiers will begin patrolling the streets of that city where drug murders have been surging. The move comes a week after a federal roundup of dozens of local officials, including 10 mayors in western Mexico, accused of helping the cartels. To top it off, authorities seized frozen sharks stuffed with one ton of cocaine. NPR's Mexico City bureau chief Jason Beaubien is with us now. And Jason, let's start with Ciudad Juarez. Why does the government feel it needs to send so many more troops in?"}
{"prompt": " Basically because what they have been doing hasn't been working. They sent in an additional 7,000 troops and federal police to basically take over Ciudad Juarez after the drug cartels threatened to execute a police officer every 48 hours unless the police chief quit, and so the police chief quit back in March, and then the army took over. At first, it looked like the strategy was working. But then over time, the killings sort of came back, the assassinations. And they got up to the point where they're having, again, nine or 10 every day, and it just looked like they needed to do something else. And so that's what's happening now. They're sending in these additional troops to see whether that can get control of the situation.", "completion": " And Jason, what can you tell us about the arrest of all those mayors in western Mexico?"}
{"prompt": " (Reading) In later weeks, though, you wanted to write because you had stories to tell. You wanted to write about the surprising openness of people in America, how eagerly they told you about their mother fighting cancer, about their sister-in-law's preemie, the kinds of things that one should hide or should reveal only to the family members who wish them well. You wanted to write about the rich people who wore shabby clothes and tattered sneakers, who looked like the night watchman in front of the large compounds in Lagos. You wanted to write that rich Americans were thin, and poor Americans were fat, and that many did not have a big house and car. You still were not sure about the guns, though, because they might have them inside their pockets.", "completion": " This sounds very much like the observations of somebody who is really discovering America for the first time. But as you say, you've been here now for more than a decade. Has the way you've seen America evolved over that time?"}
{"prompt": " I think - I mean, I think it has. I - when I first came and I first came to go to university, I remember being profoundly irritated by people not having a sense of where I had come from. And the kind of questions I got about, you know, this monolithic Africa, I found both irritating and very surprising because it hadn't quite occurred to me how little people in general knew about my part of the world. But I find that now, I mean, the things that irritated me now are quite comforting because one of the things I really like about America is that it gave me a sense of space and possibility and that I could reinvent myself. And not that I necessarily needed to, but just knowing that one has that option was very liberating for me.", "completion": " That phrase, the thing around your neck, which of course is a title of one of the stories in the book, is about loneliness, is about the experience of being a foreigner in a strange place. Can you talk about that experience?"}
{"prompt": " I think - I mean, a lot of my work, I'm very interested in gender. I think gender affects the way we experience immigration. And just observing immigrant communities in the U.S., I think that - and I think immigration in itself is a difficult thing, that it sort of involves layers of losses and gains. And I find that women, it seems to me, deal with immigration differently, and I'm interested in that. And I think a lot of my fiction is about exploring that and, you know, observing that.", "completion": " When you write about Nigeria from the United States, is that - is it difficult to do?"}
{"prompt": " No, I actually find that I distance - having that distance is very good for me. I like being at home from the outside. One has to let go of easy, sentimentalist things and just be very clear-eyed about looking at home. So, I quite like it. And sometimes I find that when I'm in Lagos, in particular, I find Lagos sometimes to be a sensory overload, and I can't write about Lagos when I'm there. And then I leave, and it's just - it's just better and clearer, and some ways, easier to write about it.", "completion": " Do you - when you do go back to Lagos, and you go back a few times a year, is that right?"}
{"prompt": " Yeah, a few days ago. And I've been trying to keep the best track of things that I could from here in Dubai.", "completion": " And so what are your contacts inside the country telling you about today's protests?"}
{"prompt": " Well there's no doubt that thousands of people did go into the streets to defy the warning yesterday from the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that there should be an end to these marches. The numbers though were smaller than we've seen over the past week, and especially important, the number of riot police that the government deployed in the main streets and squares of Tehran was much larger. And they used significant force, let's put it that way, to keep the crowds from getting larger: water cannon, teargas. They sent their troops into the crowds to beat them, and there was gunfire heard in some parts of the city.", "completion": " And we've heard a report about a bombing in Tehran. What do you know about that?"}
{"prompt": " You're welcome.", "completion": " New York Times reporter David Rohde is a free man today. Last November, while in Afghanistan on a book project, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter was kidnapped by the Taliban. But last night, after seven months in captivity, he escaped from the compound where he was held, in the North Waziristan region of Pakistan. Until today, few outside the newspaper even knew David Rohde was being held. The Times kept the story under wraps. Bill Keller is the executive editor of the New York Times and he joins us now on the line. When did you first hear from David Rohde?"}
{"prompt": " I have not heard directly from David yet, but I heard of his escape last night. I was just returning from some time in Iran, and when I landed at JFK I got a call from our foreign editor who said that David had tried to call his wife, ended up speaking with his mother-in-law, and that was our first initial report.", "completion": " How did he escape?"}
{"prompt": " Apparently he and the translator, who had been captured with him, climbed over a wall at this compound in Waziristan, where they were being held. They wandered a little while. Found Pakistani military scout who took them to the nearest Pakistani Army base and that was it.", "completion": " And what details can you give us about his treatment in captivity?"}
{"prompt": " I think I was just trying to do the arithmetic. I think it's 222 days.", "completion": " And how was he captured? What were the circumstances?"}

{"prompt": " We talked to a lot of people. There is a kind of a sub-society, I think, of people who've had experience with hostage taking and kidnapping, news organizations, NGOs, you know, government agencies. And we talked to experts in hostage situations and, of course, the family as well. And the consensus was that as hard as it is for news people to sit on a story, if we gave this thing a lot of attention, we would raise the danger level to David and his companions. If there's an international human cry, of course, that convinces the kidnappers that they've got a really valuable prize and makes them want to hang on to him longer. You just lose control of the situation. Not that we ever felt that we were greatly in control.", "completion": " Where is David Rohde now and where is he expected to go from here?"}
