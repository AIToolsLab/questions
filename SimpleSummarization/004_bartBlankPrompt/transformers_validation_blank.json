The issue is health care. Greenberg was a pollster for the Clinton White House. He surveyed public opinion on health care reform back in the early 90s before the Clinton plan went down in flames. Now Greenberg has gone back to the public for a new round of independent research, asking the same questions he asked some 15 years ago. And he joins us in the studio to talk about what he's found. Stan Greenberg, you write in The New Republic that your head is throbbing. Why is your head throbbing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what were some of the questions you were asking where you found that the answers you are getting were virtually identical to what you'd found 15 years ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, you do hear this from the Obama administration, that things are different now, that lessons have been learned from what happened in the Clinton White House with health care reform, that there's much more unity and motivation for people to come together and that they're letting Congress take the lead, not this sort of secret, opaque procedure that happened in the Clinton years. Do you think that that's the case and then the polling that you've done, does that seem to back that up?"}

His article in The New Republic is called \"Repeat the Question: Why Health Care Reform Could Fail Again.\" One of America's most important friends in the Middle East chose this week to critic the war in Iraq. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah called it, quote, \"an illegitimate foreign occupation,\" which leads to the question of why the Saudis would speak out now? The statement happened in the midst of a Saudi effort to encourage peace between Israelis and Palestinians. And when we put our question to Rachel Bronson of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, she immediately saw the statement about Iraq in terms of that other conflict. Why would King Abdullah choose now to say that what the United States is doing in Iraq is illegal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, whenever a Middle Eastern government criticizes the United States, it's common for American officials to say well, they say that in public because they have to appease their public or take care of their political considerations, but privately, they tell us something else. Do you think that might be the case here?"}

They were recruited into the armed forces over the objections of top generals in World War II. President Franklin Roosevelt insisted, though they remained a segregated unit and could not even train with white pilots. The African-American pilots flew, fought, we're shot down and sometimes captured or killed in Europe and North Africa and then they returned to the segregated country they had defended. Yesterday, the airmen received a congressional gold medal and a salute from President Bush. President GEORGE W. BUSH: And I would like to offer a gesture to help atone for all the unreturned salutes and unforgivable indignities. And so on behalf of the office I hold, and a country that honors you, I salute you for the service to the United States of America. Decades after their service, the Tuskegee airmen stood and saluted back. It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Robert Mugabe heads to Tanzania today for a meeting with other African leaders in the region. Up to now, they've rarely spoken out publicly against his repressive rule. But before Mugabe became what Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Desmond Tutu has called a cartoon figure of an African dictator, he was a revered freedom fighter. To understand how Mugabe made that turn, we reached Andrew Meldrum in Johannesburg. He reported from Zimbabwe for Britain's Observer and Guardian newspapers for 23 years, until Mugabe expelled all foreign journalists in 2003. What was it that he did, perhaps in those early years, that might be called really good for Zimbabwe?"}

Can hospitals reduce spending or not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But we could think about those things - and it might take decades to change a national culture regarding wellness, and when we see the doctor and for what purpose. In the meantime, we're spending $2.3 trillion a year on health care reform. Can the hospitals cut spending soon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me ask you about what Peter Orszag, the OMB Director, said which is that, it would be a double payment to your member hospitals to both reduce the number of the uninsured and also maintain the current level of reimbursement. That is, if fewer uninsured patients are turning up at your member hospitals because there's been a new system of health insurance offered them, why shouldn't Washington reduce reimbursements?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But let's say, of the roughly whatever it is, 45-48 million uninsured people that - let's assume success, that two-thirds of them do, indeed, become insured over a period of years. Would the hospitals, would your member hospitals accept, in principle, the idea that reimbursements from Washington should conversely decline as the number of insured patients rises at those very institutions?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a sense among both Israelis and Palestinians that you speak with on a regular basis of an imminent change in tone if not policy coming out of Washington?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it's a question. A few weeks ago, we spoke with Aaron David Miller who, of course you know, worked on Palestinian-Israeli negotiations at the State Department under President Clinton. He said it's pretty much impossible for any U.S. administration to impose a peace settlement. Would you agree with that?"}

Is it possible that because you're in Tehran it seemed as if your favorite candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, should have received more votes? Is your perspective skewed because you're in Tehran and perhaps Mr. Ahmadinejad was simply more popular in the rest of the country?"}

We've heard that limiting compensation might make it harder for some of these companies to attract the best people. What do you say to that?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So some of them have been in custody somewhere in the world for years. None of them have faced any formal criminal proceedings. They've been at Guantanamo for about six months now. And what's the process they'll go through today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In addition to not having a lawyer, this will all happen secretly. Why would it happen secretly, because some of the others haven't been that way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And we should mention, there are plenty of people who've been at Guantanamo who've said they're innocent of any crime, that they were captured mistakenly. These are people who, it's believed, there is substantial evidence against them. It's fair to presume that if anybody has been the subject of these so-called alternative procedures for interrogations, it would be these guys, right?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your company seems to have acted on that belief by marketing the Prius and having a big success there. General Motors, to give another example, though, is betting on a different technology - these hydrogen cells. What makes you think that you've picked the right technology that consumers ultimately will take at almost 100 percent rate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Press, one other question. As you look at Toyota's increasing success in North America, you must ask yourself what action should we avoid that would provoke the kind of backlash that you remember from your early days at the company?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If the senator called a prosecutor to ask about a pending investigation, could that be an ethics violation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, was it a surprise that Domenici admitted, you know, this call?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay so, how does the Justice Department explain these findings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The firings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if Congress were to find this to be a problem, what can they do about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tom Eagleton, who died yesterday, didn't consider his withdrawal a defeat. He said being vice president ain't all that much. My ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Jacki Lyden. Lebanese voters stood in line for hours today, a record turnout in a hotly contested election for a new government. The counting has begun in this tight race between two coalitions that have campaigned on very different visions for Lebanon's future. On the one side is the ruling coalition, allied with the United States. The challenger is a political bloc led by Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim organization allied with Iran and Syria. Both blocs are vying for a majority of seats in parliament. NPR's Deborah Amos has been following the vote today and joins us now from Beirut. Deb, what's at the heart of today's voting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does the Christian vote affect the outcome?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Deb, just quickly, why would the Christian vote, which I would have thought to be secular in its aspect, ally with Hezbollah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does an election for parliament change the government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And this really rippling erotic life finds its way into his poetry, of course. Let's hear one of his erotic poems. Would you share one of those?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you write that he saw history with a lover's eye and desire with a historian's eye. What did you mean by that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Almost from the beginning there is huge clash of cultures between mechanized America and Ford's utopian ideals and the way that rubber tappers and indigenous people have been living. Can you explain that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For example, didn't things go badly wrong over something as simple as serving people food?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about Ford's whole notion of trying to tame the jungle itself and create a rubber plantation, the trees?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, didn't you write that he was so distrustful of experts that here he is staking millions of his fortune on this and he never consults an expert about the rubber tree?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is Fordlandia like now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's NPR's Tom Bowman who's been embedded with U.S. Special Forces in Western Afghanistan. Tom is back in Kabul now. He's been following another developing story about the U.S. military there. And Tom this one has to do with the U.S. military investigation into airstrikes last month in another part of Western Afghanistan. These U.S. airstrikes killed Afghan civilians along with Taliban fighters. What's new on this today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tom, both sides here agree that civilians were killed in these airstrikes, the dispute is over how many. Do you think this investigation is going to lead to any changes in the way the U.S. military uses power in Afghanistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Our reviewer Alan Cheuse teaches writing at George Mason University. The books he was reviewing are \"Leaving Tangier\" by Tahar Ben Jelloun, and \"The Novel\" by Nawal El Saadawi. One of the most senior Taliban commanders is in custody. Pakistan's security forces raided a home in the southwestern city of Quetta earlier this week. They say they seized the man described as a former Taliban defense minister. This is described as the first arrest of a senior Taliban figure since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. We're going to go now to New York Times correspondent Carlotta Gall who is in Peshawar, Pakistan today. And Carlotta, could this really be the first time in all these years that they've arrested a senior Taliban figure?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Anything noteworthy about the timing here, given that we're told that the arrest took place on Monday, which is when Vice President Dick Cheney happened to be in Pakistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there lots of Taliban figures said to be in that city near the border?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I suppose this raises the question if there are said to be many Taliban figures there and they finally arrested one, if that counts as a sign of new commitment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How are stock investors reacting today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, that is one of the reasons that China's stock market is different from Western stock markets, or other Asian stock markets, and that's the level of involvement of the government, right? What did it do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now why then did what happened in China have such a big impact on the U.S.?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this the first time U.S. markets and Europe's markets have been rattled by China's financial markets?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was it that you were pressing TXU to do or not do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Had you sued?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And did all of that protest and activity give you some leverage when it came time to sell the company?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency who calls you up, and he's helping to broker this deal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so, what did you demand of them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did the question cross your mind about whether you were being co-opted or bought off in any way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you have to give up in order to gain the results that you did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One last thing. I assume that TXU was planning 11 new power plants because they made a decision that the demand was there and that people needed more power generation. How are they going to get the power?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are those steps enough to roll back the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, just more efficiency and more wind power?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Take us back to the 1970s. When you first thought of 401(k)s, did you assume that they would be a substitute for traditional-defined benefit pension plans or a supplement to them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the 401(k) system actually require that there be far more geniuses in those terms than there actually are in the workforce?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Given the decline of the defined benefit pension and the stress on Social Security, is the 401(k) here at the center of the triple crown of a failed national retirement policy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're a consultant; you talk to people, companies about their benefits packages and individuals. Do you get the sense that they'd really like to get out from under this commitment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, takes us back to the '70s. Typically, how long did the 65-year- old who retired from work - how much longer did that person live and how much longer would that person need retirement income for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Dr. Tiller was pronounced dead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand that someone is now in custody. What do we know about the suspect?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Tiller's clinic was bombed in 1986. And in the early '90s, he was shot in both arms. And just a few months ago, he was acquitted in a criminal case. He'd been charged with violating a Kansas law that required two independent doctors to agree that a late-term abortion is necessary. What made Dr. Tiller literally such a target?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how have abortion rights opponents in Kansas reacted to today's shooting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And supporters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Julie, let's pick up where Karen Brown left off. How likely is it that we'll see Congress require that all Americans have health insurance?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So break it down for me. How would a public plan work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This all sounds very expensive. And it spurred a lot of discussion about how to pay for it, cutting health care costs, taxes on health insurance benefits, even new taxes on sweetened drinks. What do you think is likely to emerge from all of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I'm just thinking $1.5 trillion is the size of the U.S. debt to China, Julie. I understand the Senate is farther along in considering this health care overhaul. Tell us what we're likely to see over the summer weeks and months ahead, will you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how long is this bankruptcy procedure expected to take?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When GM comes out of bankruptcy, Frank, what's it going to look like? What happens to its brand?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Frank, I understand that the American taxpayers will spend a total of more than $50 billion to rescue this company. That's a lot. Let's say GM comes out leaner, fewer debts, fewer divisions like Saturn or Pontiac. Is this going to ensure that it survives?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Frank, as we know, the recession's really demolished car sales, and they're down 50 percent. Can GM market its way out of this? Are people going to start buying cars as they once did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'd like to start with a basic question. China already owns about $1.5 trillion in U.S. treasury bills, and you have described that relationship between the U.S. and China, kind of, as that of a crack addict and a dealer. Could you explain what you mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does Secretary Geithner want to accomplish with China this week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does Secretary Geithner persuade them to keep buying treasury bills?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, the timing of this visit is interesting with the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre coming just on Thursday. How might that affect these talks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " All this started when a man named Simon Martin, who was secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Annapolis, Maryland, bought a parrot in Baltimore for his wife 10 days before Christmas in 1929. What happened after that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The U.S. Public Health Service runs the Hygienic Laboratory, and it gets involved. And the guy the government puts in charge of the investigation is a scientist named Charles Armstrong. What's his mission?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the remarkable thing about this is that even as parrots are being exhumed and newspapers are reporting on is a parrot sick, has it got puffy eyes, is it not, a week or so after this all begins, by January 15, it's over. The Chicago Daily Tribune reports: U.S. alarm over parrot fever not warranted. The Wall Street Journal mocks it. What's happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jon Wertheim has written a new book about that Wimbledon final. It's called \"Strokes of Genius: Federer, Nadal, and the Greatest Match Ever played.\" Now, that's a bold statement. Many tennis fanatics point to the 1980 final between Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe as the greatest ever. So, Jon Wertheim, make your case. Why was this better?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You also say that in the very first point in the match, this was the perfect prelude. Why's that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Nadal took the first two sets, and he appears to be cruising to his first Wimbledon title. Then in the third set, Federer comes out and it's riveting, guns blazing, wins on a tie breaker despite a rain delay, and we're up to the fourth set now. Nadal was up five games to two, and he could have closed it out with one more point, but that didn't happen. What did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, the match goes well past 9 p.m. local time. Now, Wimbledon isn't really equipped for that. What was it like so late at night?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jon Wertheim writes about tennis for Sports Illustrated. His new book is called \"Strokes of Genius: Federer, Nadal, and the Greatest Match Ever Played,\" of course, until there's some replay, huh, Jon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we should also point out that you clerked for David Souter. He, of course, is the justice that Sotomayor will replace. Were you surprised to hear the A-bomb, the activist word, dropped so quickly after her name was announced?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, the mechanics of this. You decided to go undercover posing as an evangelical Christian. And I understand that you already had a book deal. Why couldn't you be honest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You left Liberty University without telling any of these people, your friends and your teachers who you really were, although one or two people had suspicions. Later, after you're back at Brown, you go back and you tell people the truth. What was that like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For more on Kevin Roose's book, including an excerpt, go to our Web site, npr.org. So how is the book being received at Liberty? We have a student on the line. Jan Dervish, what's been the reaction to the book on campus?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jan Dervish is the secretary of the College Democrats at Liberty University. You might remember that we reported on Liberty last week. The school recently withdrew official recognition of the College Democrats club on campus. The ticking point, the student's support of Democratic candidates who defend abortion rights. We got a lot of response to that story. This week, the College Dems met with school president Jerry Falwell Jr. He had proposed that they affiliate with Virginia Democrats for Life. So, Jan Dervish, what did you think of that idea?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why is important for you to be recognized officially? What do you get out of recognition?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We also talked to Mr. Falwell today about the meetings you had this week. Mr. JERRY FALWELL JR. (Founder, Liberty University): We started looking for ways that they could support the Democratic issues that they believe in without supporting the abortion and marriage planks that are contrary to the university's mission and religious beliefs. One proposal was that we could operate as a club, but as a club, not support candidates who held those positions. So Jan, what do the College Dems think of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One final question, Jan, when do you expect this to be resolved?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your brother Fathi was once a provincial governor in Libya, and he believed in improving the infrastructure - he's known as a technocrat - but he also believed in law and order. And two decades later, he was jailed after a speech calling for democracy and free speech. Could you give us a short summary of his beliefs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When was the last time you saw your brother Fathi?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Because he sent you here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you pick one?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think the U.S. should do at this point, vis-a-vis its relations with Libya?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Good. Now, you find that humans have evolved to depend on cooked food. Would you explain that a little bit and tell us how cooking does make us human?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, how does cooking make food more nutritious?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did cooking, which you say started about 1.9 million years ago, how did it change us socially?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's the dish called? What's the name of the dish?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, this is a - dal is actually a fairly common Indian food, but what gives it the Chilean kick?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, so that makes it Chilean. That's good enough for us. Now, this is primarily a lentil dish. Could you describe it for us, what it looks like, what it tastes like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you prepare it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you throw in a little bit of cilantro on top?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Always. Okay, now, what does that do to the flavor?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Boy, so I have this image in my mind of you sitting on the beach at the end of the day around a campfire and a big pot's in the middle. Does that sound accurate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, Valerie, it's been a pleasure to talk to you. Before I let you go, I have to ask you a question, since we are asking people to send us delicious dishes that cost less than $10. What's the price tag for this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it was how long before you were able to call your parents in North Dakota?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I interviewed your father back in April, while you were still in prison, and he told me that you had made statements under pressure \u2014 under threat \u2014 while you were being held in Evin prison. Was that the case, and if that was the case, what did you confess to under duress?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me take you back just a bit to those interrogations in Evin prison. Can you describe what that was like? Was there any physical threat? Was it purely psychological threat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of your defense attorney's, Saleh Nikbakht, said after your release that part of the evidence against you was that you had a document about the U.S. invasion of Iraq that you had copied while you were working as a translator for a powerful council within Iran's clerical government. How did you get this document? What was that about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You brought it to their attention?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did you have this document in the first place? How did you come to have that in your house?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was it a document you were translating?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what it was about that made you want to have that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This defense attorney had described your work as being for a clerical council that advises Iran's supreme religious leader. Was that also work you were doing, separate from the work you're describing with the think tank?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for any council that advised the Iranian government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's another thing that we should clear up here. And that's a statement made from the same defense attorney, Mr. Nikbakht. He disclosed an allegation that you had met with someone who he said was named Mr. Peterson who worked for the CIA. And according to your defense attorney, this man tried to recruit you. Did you have any conversations with anyone who claimed to be working for the CIA and who may have tried to recruit you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So where is that coming from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the name, I mean, there's a fair amount of specificity in what he is saying here, this name, Mr. Peterson, invented out of whole cloth? Was this part of the government evidence and you're now saying it's absolutely not true?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were in captivity, held in Iran for 100 days. Tell me about those days in Evin prison. What filled your time, what you thought about, what kept you going?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What were those conversations like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Roxana, you've lived in Iran for some years. How do you read your release on the suspended sentence? Do you see this as some sort of power play between the hardliners in Iran and reformists?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're heading home now to North Dakota?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you imagine going back to Iran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as you well know, Judge Sotomayor is no stranger to the Senate. You voted against her back in 1998, when she was nominated to the court of appeals. Is there any reason to think that your vote might go the other way this time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You didn't remember that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to ask you about some talking points that conservative activists are circulating, and they include a lecture that Judge Sotomayor gave back in 2002. She was talking about Latino and Latina presence in the judiciary. And she said this: The aspiration to impartiality is just that. It denies the fact that we are, by our experiences, making different choices than others. And she went on to say: I simply do not know what that difference will be in my judging, but I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage. What do you make of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think there is some value to having diversity on the court? Is there value in having another woman and the first Hispanic - or is that irrelevant, do you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And briefly, Senator Grassley, do you give some weight to the political argument that Republicans simply can't afford to alienate Hispanic voters by rejecting this nominee?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But now, all these people are having to flee, and this charity has come in that has already been banned. Would you tell us a little bit more about Falah-e-Insaniat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, in the end, you wrote a piece about the next generation of the Taliban, and that got you and your wife deported. What happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How long is that drive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm. What do you think, then, of articles like \"Pakistan on the Brink\" or \"Pakistan: Failed State\"? What's your reaction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The whole phrase from this intellectual who coined, you know, the idea to live or to perish forever was meant to establish Pakistan's independence. How do you read that phrase today? Because once again, that country's at a turning point. Which is it going to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So that's what we're smelling?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Rose petal jam. How many kinds of roses are in this garden?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wow. How much time do you have to spend in your five acres of roses?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Heritage Rosarium is closed now until next Memorial Day weekend, but you can still get a glimpse at our Web site, at npr.org. This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. The president of Zimbabwe celebrates his birthday this weekend with a big bash. The festivities planned for Robert Mugabe, who's ruled the country for 27 years, will reportedly cost 300 million Zimbabwe dollars. But with the country's yearly inflation rate now running at 1,600 percent, the price tag will change by the time the party is over. And while the president is feasting, the average Zimbabwean can't even get a loaf of bread. We go now to NPR's special Africa correspondent, Charlayne Hunter-Gault. Hello?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So why is Robert Mugabe throwing such a lavish and very public party for his 83rd birthday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are lots of these personal finance blogs. Tell us exactly what they are. What are the parameters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, but ultimately, is it effective? Is there any way to know that these Web sites really help people curb their spending, cut down on debt, and really get control of their finances?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, in a sense, though, does that mean that it's a single-issue group that is ushering out of power Vladimir Putin?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you speak about bringing a certain amount of equality economically to the country, break down for us exactly what has happened in the last 10 years with this oil money that has poured into Russia. Who's gotten rich and who's gotten poor?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " No matter who gets elected next year when Putin's second and final term is up, what does the future look like without Vladimir Putin at the helm?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If someone said appointed - it will be very different than if there were free and fair elections - are you saying there won't be the appearance of elections?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're famous, you're popular. Are you running for president? Would you run for president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does being one of the most brilliant chess players in the world make you more able to figure out the endgame of all of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is his objective in these visits?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did he get any promises or indication how long people would be held in these camps?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, one thing we know, Philip, is that the U.N. Human Rights Council is planning a special session on Sri Lanka on Monday because there has been pressure for war-crimes investigations. Did Ban Ki-moon address that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That is so much fun, and I'm really glad that you gave that back to the American public. What kind of America do you conjure up and think about as you leaf through all these old typescripts, parchments, mimeographs, carbon copies? What sort of sense of America came back to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how do we begin?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you ever do them with honey or something like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There has been, you know, a lot of push back on this question of whether some of the detainees at Guantanamo should be released in to the United States and when we say released seems we're talking about two different things. One would be people who are considered eligible for release in to the general population but also a large group that would be released into the U.S. prison system. And we heard the FBI director Robert Mueller today say he is concerned about threats to U.S. safety even if those people are kept in supermax facilities in the states. Do you share those concerns?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would you do that? How would you protect the people of Florence, Colorado say or for Leavenworth, Kansas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For detainees who are judged to pose a lesser risk, there's a push to get other countries to accept them for resettlement and there has been a lot of reluctance on the part of other countries to take them. Do you think that if the United States does not say we will let some of these detainees come live in our country, do we have an argument to countries in Europe or elsewhere around the world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you imagine a politician who would want to make that argument to his or her constituents back home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And let's sort of take a peek under the hood, Aaron. What would carmakers need to do to make engines more efficient, to meet these standards?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does Eco Boost work? What does it boost?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Other technology, engine technology, in particular, that would help them meet these goals?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If they're making cars that are lighter to try to meet these standards as well, make them more efficient, there are concerns, then, about safety. What about that, how do the carmakers balance safety standards with these fuel efficiency standards?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But do those prices eventually come down - I mean, as they're used more, and they become more accepted?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm doing fine. Thanks very much. NASCAR fans are very familiar with this story. But if you could bring the rest of us up to speed, please, what is this cheating scandal about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How tolerant are the fans of this sort of thing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh, goodness. It's been so much fun to talk about cheating that I've almost run out of time to ask about Toyota. Very, very briefly, how are fans taking the news of a Toyota in the race?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now I want to get to individual positions in a moment. But generally speaking, aren't Republicans in a difficult position here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any other top candidates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about a much talked about candidate, Rudolph Giuliani?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Juan, what about Chuck Hagle, senator from Nebraska, outright opponent of the president's position in Iraq, and impossible candidate. Is he it? Is he the only one that's really out there in fierce opposition?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the scene there today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So again, the side you're standing on is largely pro-government. And with Lebanese politics being what they are - anti- or against Syria - which had had a lot of say in Lebanon for many years; what about the opposite side of the square there - the opposition protestors?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's a little hard to hear you there in Beirut, but let me just ask you a final question. Syria has also been implicated in Hariri's assassination, by those conducting an investigation. Where does that investigation stand at two years on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's maybe something to remember that three years ago the Iraqi government issued an arrest warrant for Sadr in connection with the murder of another Shiite cleric. Is it possible he could be arrested now, at this point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that mean that the U.S. and Iraqi forces will actually go into Sadr City, the slum that is his base of support, as part of this new security plan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " then what actually is happening as part of this new plan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And good morning to you. The president has said there'll be this temporary surge in troops, I know. But that's not the only thing we're getting for 245 billion, is it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Although how do you increase basic military spending and spend all this morning on two wars and balance the budget within five years as the president has promised to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does any of this match up with the fact that Democrats, and Republicans we should mention, are talking about things like increasing healthcare?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal and a regular guest on this program. Now on Mondays, the business report on NPR News focuses on technology, and today we have the new version of Microsoft Office. Has a new look, is designed to limit the amount of mousing around, moving around, clicking and pointing. The idea that you could actually get some work down rather than trying to figure out how the computer works. To find out more, we called David Pogue, who double-clicks through technology for the New York Times. Okay. I'm so used to using a mouse and moving this arrow around on the screen to click on things, that I really don't understand how else you would do. How do you do it otherwise?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what do you do that's different? I mean if you play with this Microsoft Office, how else do you navigate around the computer and all the different files in there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm going to try to explain this. I mean if you're ever confused, someone might say go to the Start button, click on the Start button, a bunch of choices come up. And then you click on one of those and a bunch more choices come up. And you're telling me that now it looks like the dashboard of an airplane with a bunch of little controls all over the place but in plain sight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could this be a precursor of much bigger changes, though - a totally different way of approaching the computer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " No, but where are they heading with this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Before mouses and icons and that sort of thing, people just typed a command into a computer. Might we eventually head back toward that system then?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's begin with the fighting itself. What are you hearing? Is it now completely finished?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what does this mean for the government, particularly the president, who over the weekend was declaring victory?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any kind of aid getting to the people who are still there, either through the government or through outside organizations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Catherine Johnson. I met her when I visited Fairfax High School a few months. And today, she's here at NPR headquarters. So Catherine, what did you decide to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what does your mom think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Pearl Johnson, Catherine's mother. She's here with us, too. Catherine, tell me about that conversation, when you two sat down together and tried to figure out how to make Hampton work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you started to think about what it's going to be like when she's not in the house?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the feeling today on the streets of Colombo?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The rebels' last stand was on a tiny patch of land, where as many as perhaps 100,000 refugees were being held. The government says they're being released today. What are you hearing about them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, with no outsiders allowed in that area, no journalists, no aid organizations, when and how do you expect to get a clearer picture of what is going on there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you heard any stories from people who have managed to make it out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does a country that has been at war with itself for 25 years even start thinking about the future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What sorts of (unintelligible) injuries are we talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ben, when you were playing youth sports, where do you think the pressure came from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ben, will you let your kids play sports?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So we're here today to talk about the Hubble's greatest contributions to science. One, of course, is helping scientists figure out something called the Hubble Constant. What is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how did the Hubble telescope help us figure that out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...just those pictures have changed the way we think about the scope of our universe?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that true? You put on a movie?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do the pilot fly in any particular way because there're horses onboard?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When there's turbulence, do they bounce around?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I know that Tex Sutton transports horses, thoroughbreds and show horses. Do you notice the difference among the kinds of horses about how well they handle the stress?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do they show that they're frightened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do the race horses have a buddy with them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have an eye for horses about what kind of races they're going to be when you spend some time with them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, as I understand it, you recently asked the CIA about the dates on which you received briefings from them back in 2002. Is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, going back to the dates when the CIA originally said you were briefed and you determined you weren't, was it that those dates were not the dates of briefings? I mean, were there other briefings in May or June? Or they simply had phantom dates when an appointment might have been made but nothing ever happened at all during that time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you are known for keeping those spiral notebooks. Your records are very good. When you told this to the CIA, what did they say about the supposed four briefings that you had?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And was there any explanation as to how they had come up with those other dates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to read to you some of the things that some Republicans have said about what speaker Pelosi said. Senator Kit Bond of Missouri, now vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, says, it is outrageous that a member of Congress would call our terror fighters liars. House GOP leader John Boehner says, it's hard for me to imagine that our intelligence area would ever mislead a member of Congress. What do you think of those remarks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Nancy Pelosi says she was misled. When asked if she was lied to by the briefers, she says, yes. Were you misled? Were you lied then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just one last question. At the September 27, 2002 briefing that you did get, the one briefing that's confirmed, there was staff present. You were the chair of intelligence. Have you gone back to check with your staff to see that that person's recollection of the briefing and your recollection are the same?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And can you describe the zone, please, where the fighting is going on? And can you describe the zone, please, where the fighting is going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are reports of some of these civilians wading across a lagoon, essentially wading across the frontline to get to safety. There are reports of some of these civilians wading across a lagoon, essentially wading across the frontline to get to safety. Have you confirmed that? Have you confirmed that?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Speaking of doctors, we mentioned these attacks on a makeshift hospital. Speaking of doctors, we mentioned these attacks on a makeshift hospital. Reports that the doctors have abandoned the hospital, there are patients still inside. Reports that the doctors have abandoned the hospital, there are patients still inside. What can you tell us about that? What can you tell us about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Weiss, there have been 25 years now of civil war in Sri Lanka. Mr. Weiss, there have been 25 years now of civil war in Sri Lanka. The rebels want a separate nation for the Tamils. The rebels want a separate nation for the Tamils. And this is being described as the last stand. And this is being described as the last stand. Do you really see this as an endpoint in this civil war? Do you really see this as an endpoint in this civil war?"}

If civilians are leaving, do you see the government then going in and essentially wiping out the Tamil Tigers up there? If civilians are leaving, do you see the government then going in and essentially wiping out the Tamil Tigers up there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Smith, the pilot of that same flight - Continental Connections Flight 3407 - Marvin Renslow apparently made around $55,000 a year. And he commuted to Newark from his home near Tampa, Florida. How common are stories like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But let me ask you about something that is not academic. It's come up at the NTSB hearing. Renslow and his co-pilot, Rebecca Shaw, commuted by air, and evidently they and other Colgan officers slept in what's called a crew room at Newark Airport, even though they weren't supposed to do that. But they had to sleep sometime because they're - it's taking hours for them to get to work. Common, uncommon, unheard of - what would you say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But you say we shouldn't feel anxious as passengers. But should we feel that the B-team is in the cockpit when we're flying a regional airline?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me come back to the point where I began, which is with fatigue. This is not a 9-to-5 job, being an airline pilot, and how common is it to be flying when you really haven't had a night's sleep for many, many hours and frankly, when you might be more tired than you should be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. Tomorrow, a New York court will hear arguments over a sport in which the rules sound like they come out of \"Through the Looking Glass.\" The competitors are Richard and Alex Rodriguez. And the spirit of fellowship and mutual respect among them is just about nill. It's the America's Cup yacht race, named for the 19th century schooner that won the first competition, and governed by a Deed of Gift that sets out those Lewis Carroll-like rules. Bruce Knecht has written about the America's Cup and other maritime matters, and joins us from New York. Bruce Knecht, who holds the America's Cup now, and who wants it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the billionaire who wants to win it from him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A New York court - a state supreme court - which is really, by no means, the highest court in New York state, heard the matter of this bogus yacht club. What did it decide?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now this trophy - the America's Cup trophy - is a storied trophy. I gather it's the oldest sporting trophy that has continuously been held by some winner of a competition. In the past, were there animosities as intense as that between Bertarelli and Ellison today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're going to be in court tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if Gates is calling for fresh thinking and if the White House is looking for a new path forward, what do they want him to do differently?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now General McChrystal will still have to go through a confirmation. What are some of the tough questions that he might face?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you think the news of his appointment will be met on the ground there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Andrew Exum is a fellow with the Center for a New American Security. And for more on this story, we now turn to NPR health policy correspondent Julie Rovner. Julie, as Nancy Anne DeParle just mentioned, Congress is already at work on health care legislation, so why this announcement at this particular time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so how are the incentives aligned in this case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the groups want to make some suggestions on how to save money. How big are the sacrifices that these groups are willing to make to cut costs here? Are we talking about real reduction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what about the hard decisions? What will it take to save the $2 billion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Julie, you've been covering this issue for a very long time. And when people talk about health care in this town sometimes they just roll their eyes. What's different? What's changed since the Clintons rolled out their massive health care reform plan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand it's difficult for the U.N. and independent journalists to get into the area of fighting, but what do you know about what's been going on this past weekend?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And killed at the hands of the Sri Lankan army?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the government has claimed in recent months that they believe they are close to extinguishing the Tamil-Tiger-led rebellion. Is this, from the government's perspective, their last sort of offensive, if you will, in an attempt to extinguish this rebellion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Sri Lankan government claims that the Tamil Tigers are using civilians as human shields, but of course at the same time, the government has not allowed anybody to go and assess the situation there. Do you expect the government to ease their position on that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what can the U.N. do at this point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you're back in the U.S. You haven't visited us in a few years. Where you been?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So back then, you were still with Def Jam records, and you've actually said people die to get onto the Def Jam label, and then you say, and I nearly died being on it. What happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Guy Raz. Half a million jobs cut, a spike in the unemployment rate, the highest since 1983, 10 of the biggest banks ordered to raise $75 billion in capital just to stay afloat, and that was the good news in the past few days. NPR's Planet Money man, Adam Davidson, is here to help us make sense of the economic week. Adam, let's start with unemployment. Just how good can the news be if 539,000 people lost their jobs just last month?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, how do those banks raise that kind of money? I mean, how does Bank of America come up with $34 billion like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Adam, are we moving in the right direction? Is the crisis coming to an end?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the bankers who are leveraging at 30 to one ratios. Weren't they greedy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You say this crisis actually has a silver lining. What is it, in your view?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you linked Iranian involvement to a specific incident or operation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's been much interest in a particular incident in recent days near the city of Karbala, where a number of insurgents in U.S. military uniforms - what looked like them, anyway - got past a number of checkpoints and were involved in a gunfight in which a number of Americans were killed. Do you believe Iran had a role in that specific incident?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you looking at Iran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Burns, you mentioned that the United States has the right of self-defense here. Does that right of self-defense give the United States the right to strike targets within Iran in response to this should the president choose to do so?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I just want to clarify something here. President Bush, in an interview with NPR earlier this week, said that the United States did not intend to invade Iran. Are you saying the United States does not intend to strike Iran in any way, which I suppose would say you don't intend an air strike or any other kind of military operation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But I want to understand which of those statements is operative. You don't intend to invade or you don't intend to strike, given this particular context?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Burns, one other question. On this program, we heard from Professor Ali Ansari, director of the Institute of Iranian Studies at Scotland's St. Andrews University. He was talking about the consequences of this confrontation. And he said, this is a quote, \"By raising the tension and by raising the level of armed forces in the region, even if both sides are not interested in military conflict, you're increasing the likelihood that an accidental escalation is going to take place.\" Is there any truth in that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, which country is - or which, if you will, China or Africa - is benefiting from this really fast-growing trade relationship?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, how does this differ - this relationship with China differ from Africa's traditional economic partners in the West?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " China's presence in Africa, and that new competition that it represents, has that affected the U.S. and other Western countries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did you do this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what happens? How are our brains, our minds altered or changed when we consume foods that have a very high content of salt, fat and sugar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about festival darlings, if you will. Last year, was \"Little Miss Sunshine.\" Of course, now that film is up for best picture in the Academy Awards. Are there any breakthrough movies from Sundance, this year, like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, onto other movies in the festival. What have you seen that you really like, Ken?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, we talked often in the past about the documentaries at Sundance. What stands out this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Former President Jimmy Carter is responding to those charges this week. In his latest book, Carter wrote of his travels in the Middle East and analyzed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He's been accused of getting some facts wrong, of mislabeling maps, and of slanting the book against Israel. : Mr. President, perhaps I could begin with the title of your book, which has caused a bit of debate. Could you just make briefly the best case you can for why apartheid is the right word to use?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Rob, what has been the response of gay rights groups?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And has Prime Minister Tony Blair weighed in, in all of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, just briefly, Rob, is there a possibility of a compromise?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thanks very much. NPR's Rob Gifford in London. One of the senior leaders of the ousted government in Somalia is in Nairobi after turning himself into Kenyan authorities at the border. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was head of the Executive Council of the Islamic Courts Union. He's described as a moderate and a potential peacemaker. We go now to NPR's Gwen Thompkins, who is in Nairobi. And Gwen, exactly how did this guy wind up in Nairobi? Was he wanted, as are some of the Islam's leaders in Somalia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the U.S. has responded positively to this event. It's believed he can play a role in reconciling the various factions in Somalia. Can he?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Review a little bit of history for us. Why did Sadr's group boycott parliament in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is it a hopeful sign at all that they've now decided to comeback to the formal political process?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why'd they come back?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are they actually controlled by the same guy? Does Moqtada al-Sadr really tell both those groups what to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Hilterman, I want to ask about one of the things you said. You forecast that as U.S. troops flood Baghdad as part of this so-called surge, that Sadr's militia may melt away but remain active. Have Sadr's militiamen already said we're going to go underground but continue fighting in response to the U.S. increase in troops?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you know people who've been sick with swine flu?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does San Miguel de Allende feel different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you see anything that you would think of as symptoms of H1N1 swine flu?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you feel like you have enough resources?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand that some of the fears were spread by rumors that it was a terrorist attack. Would you tell me about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds like at every point, things were breaking down, people not using water, lots of fear and suspicion. How did that actually spread the disease?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, as a medical anthropologist, what lessons do you take away? What would be the bottom line?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did he do that with the very camera that you're going to be taking with you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you going to take a picture with this camera?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where are you taking them from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When these repairs are completed, NASA says that the Hubble is going to go out of operation, and I'm just wondering, since you have had such a long and intimate relationship, how do you feel about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I have to tell you, when I opened this book, I was shocked to see how ubiquitous these images were. It's full of people, nicely dressed, mostly middle-class students gathered around dead bodies, more than 100 such images. Why this fascination?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It seems as if, virtually, every medical class that ever existed posed with their cadavers. What was going on in their relationship between those who were living and the person who was dead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Professional resurrectionists? That was actually a job title back then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " On the part of the medical students, their attitude captures my fascination. Virtually every picture of people standing around the cadavers in this book, they write on each medical table like, we have shuffled off his mortal coil, or, he lived for others but died for us, or, a thing of beauty is a joy forever. I mean, were they uncomfortable? What was all the dark humor about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Death is highly medicalized now, something to be avoided if at all possible. When did it change? When did these group portraits stop being taken?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the CDC this afternoon says that the H1N1 virus lacks several of the genes that made the 1918 pandemic virus so deadly. Does that mean that we can breath easier now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Our initial information about the outbreaks in Mexico, I understand, were mostly in hospital patients, not in the general population. Did those accounts give us an accurate or inaccurate picture at the outset of what this flu was all about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in Mexico, what should be done now in Mexico if, indeed, there is a population of people infected that's substantially larger than anywhere else in the world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How important is getting an answer to the question of why this flu sickened people worse in Mexico than it did in the U.S.? Do you need to have that answer in order to proceed or is it an interesting academic detail but one you could live without knowing the answer to for now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it's been a week of much worrying about this, certainly throughout the United States and in much of the world. Are you any less worried at the end of the week than you were at the beginning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For some analysis and history behind today's announcement, we turn now to NPR's Frank Langfitt. He covers the auto industry, and he's been working the Chrysler story in Detroit this week. Frank, we know the details of this attempt to save Chrysler, but in the grand scheme of things, why is President Obama doing this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's look at the deal from the other side. What's in it for Fiat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, does Fiat have any other obligations, though, as part of the deal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the administration is talking about a very quick bankruptcy, 30 to 60 days. Is that realistic?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the collapse in car sales, generally, has been a crisis for the entire auto industry, but Chrysler seems to have been a company in crisis for a long time. What is it about Chrysler that leads the industry into bankruptcy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How far are we from having a vaccine that could inoculate people against the swine flu?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And has the decision been made yet to go ahead and actually produce such a vaccine?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Give us a sense of some of the calculations that have to be made before that decision can be made. For example, would we likely be given a swine flu vaccine in addition to, would it be mixed in the cocktail for next year's flu shots, or would it replace things that would otherwise be in those shots?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As you think about how the nation's public health system is responding to this flu outbreak and how it might continue to respond, how would you describe, say, the best outcome you could imagine to this swine flu?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that you're still waiting on learning the characteristics of this particular swine flu virus and to see just how bad it is or how well doctors do in trying to hold it at bay for a while?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I know that people go through tabletop exercises trying to figure out what we do about a new flu outbreak. Are we prepared for this? I mean, are we seeing your office and the CDC, are they responding to a challenge that they've game planned pretty well and have the staff on hand to do, or we've been caught unawares to some extent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The same virus is found to sicken people very badly in Mexico. It's suspected in more than 100 deaths there. But in this country, the confirmed cases are very mild. What does that say to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does it say to you if an outbreak in a New York City school seems to affect a couple of dozen kids there, but it doesn't seem to extend to the neighborhood around the school or to the families of the students who have it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And at this point, do we assume that people are trying to track the swine flu virus back to some point of origin in Mexico and to find the village, the farm, the individual who might've first contracted this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it somehow has gotten, we assume, from Mexico to New York City, a few other points in this country, to New Zealand and to Scotland. I mean, do we assume if it - this would perhaps be practically impossible, but at least in theory, one could draw dotted lines between individual people and connect them all together from Wellington to Edinburgh or wherever?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The briefer from the CDC told people today to expect things to get worse in this country. Why? Why should one expect that an outbreak would be worse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tom, I know the Mexican finance minister was at these meetings. Has the IMF or the World Bank address the swine flu outbreak?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, as we know, the main purpose of these meetings has been to work out the details of $1 trillion plan to bolster countries in economic difficulty. And we first heard about this plan three weeks ago at the G-20 meeting in London, and we discussed it here on this program. How is that coming together?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the main obstacles?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How has that played out this weekend?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've covered Iraq since long before the invasion. What are your thoughts about the country today with just this new spike in the bombings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of the stories that I recall you doing the most was about a single individual who was collecting the bodies of the dead. Could you talk about that story?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Were you able to develop anything that you would call affection for Iraq in the midst of all this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is sort of a charming story. Would you tell us about some of these doors you're now just starting to peek through with this little, one month old wooly mammoth?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you find specimens in her lungs, for example, her stomach?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how did she perish?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was that like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did she look like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did she have a little wooly coat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris. With so much talk lately of trouble in Afghanistan, instability in Pakistan, and debate over direct talks with Iran, one country has been getting far less attention than usual: Iraq. That's also because it's been relatively peaceful - that is, until this week. Yesterday was the deadliest single day of violence in more than a year. And there was more bloodshed today. Two attackers detonated explosive vests near an important Shiite mosque in Baghdad. At least 60 people were killed. The gains made by the U.S. and Iraqi forces now look more fragile than they did just a few weeks ago. I'm joined by NPR's Baghdad bureau chief, Quil Lawrence. Quil, what's behind the recent violence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And many of the victims in these bombings were not Iraqi. They were Shiite pilgrims from Iran. Why do they think they're being targeted?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Overall, how are Iraqis reacting to the latest wave of bombs? Is this a sign of what might happen when the U.S. begins pulling out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This increase tempo of violence raises a lot of questions for the U.S. Could it possibly slow the pace of troop withdrawal? Is Iraq ready to take care of security on its own?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Adam, how did you get this idea? When did you decide that you wanted to try to take this technology that you've been working on and apply it to Twitter, to come up with something I guess you could call tweetokinesis(ph)?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Adam Wilson, do me a favor. Take a step back, and in the simplest terms possible, try to help me understand how this works. Do you have to wear some sort of headgear, and do you think about what you actually want to say, what message you want to send? How does it work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you really have to concentrate in order to do this? Do you have to clear your mind of all other thought?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the possible practical applications? Could this help people with ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease or someone with a spinal injury or someone who's lost their speech because of a stroke?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are more troops, in your opinion, needed in Afghanistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates visited Afghanistan, it was seen as showing support for Afghan President Hamid Karzai. How secure is that government - the Afghan government - at this stage of the game? And what are the state of relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, just finally circling back to the question of more troops, how much good would just simply sending in more troops do in Afghanistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But again, no talking to Iran or Syria. What did Rice say about how she's approaching the conflicts in the Middle East?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the Arab-Israeli issue? Was there any progress there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can you see?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How serious has the opposition to Ahmadinejad become?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Remind us of who is in the parliament. There are conservatives, fundamentalists there. Is that correct? Are they part of this opposition?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You also mentioned the economy is a problem - inflation, unemployment. Those are problems, correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And just recently, we saw a student protest at Tehran University. Does that reflect an unease among younger people in Iran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Not long after the president spoke with CBS, Iraq carried out two more executions. The men were hanged before dawn today. One was Barzan al-Tikriti, Saddam's half-brother and intelligence chief. The other was a judge under Saddam. The report that's going to follow here lasts a little more than three minutes, and we should warn you that some people will find it extremely disturbing, because Iraqi officials showed a videotape of the executions to reporters, including NPR's Jamie Tarabay. And Jamie, what did you see?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jamie, why did Iraqi officials think it was necessary to call you in and show you this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Were there Iraqi's among this group of people who were brought in to see the videotape?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We're talking with NPR's Jamie Tarabay in Baghdad, at a very busy time in Iraq. And Jamie, I want to ask you about another story. Last week, a number of Iranians were arrested by the United States inside Iraq in the northern city of Erbil. And that story is continuing to develop. What's happening now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you say keep momentum going, what momentum?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here's something else that's in the Israeli media today anyway. Israel announced new construction in the West Bank?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A lot of businesses since the 1960s have been forced or have decided to have more diverse workforces. How has that affected their business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How could that be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh, my goodness. Did this study have an example of how white people are thinking differently just because black people are in the room, say?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " How was the Taliban able to move into Buner? Was it by overcoming government resistance or through the absence of any government resistance?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The notion that there could actually be at some point a Taliban regime in Pakistan is chilling to much of the world for that reason. Do you understand where the bright line is, at least in the U.S. regard? Is there something that would happen in Pakistan that American policymakers regard as simply unacceptable advance because it might conceivably lead to that highly undesirable result?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. Think back to the news last December for a moment. Bank of America was trying to get out of its deal to buy Merrill Lynch. You might remember stories about government officials pressuring the bank to go ahead with the deal despite Merrill's growing losses. Not much was known about exactly how the government got its way, only that it did. Well, today the back story emerged. That's thanks to depositions conducted by New York's attorney general who's been looking into a related matter. And joining me now from New York is NPR's Jim Zarroli. Jim remind us - why were U.S. officials so anxious to see this deal go through?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how did Secretary Paulson respond?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it appears that Ken Lewis gave in to the government's demand or did he first try to fight it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how did Bank of America's shareholders respond when they found out what kind of shape Merrill Lynch was really in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now we're coming down. So what are some of the items now that fewer people define as necessities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How is the dishwasher doing in terms of necessity/luxury?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want you to tell us what you found out about people's view of landlines versus cell phones. Who thinks which is more necessary and which is more luxurious?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, it's now reported that as many as one in three credit card holders have seen some sort of change in their contract or their payment arrangement. What's going on? Why is this so widespread?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, in some cases, as I understand, the banks are just closing out credit cards altogether, canceling the cards. But help me understand something, if someone is having a hard time making their payments, and the credit card company raises the interest rate, doesn't that make matters worse? Won't that make it harder for someone to actually meet their financial responsibility?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, is this just happening to people who are in arrears or are credit card holders in good standing also seeing changes in their contracts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the justification for that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can people do to protect themselves from rate hikes and changes on the contract?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're going to use these primarily to look for lost people? You're not planning to chase criminals with these, are you?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the response from the community?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Chief Berger, you noted that you have a lot of older people there in Palm Bay. Has there been any confusion, any UFO sightings, people wondering what the heck is that up in the sky?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, could you explain how the disabler works? When do drivers get warnings and when do the dealers cut off the cord?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you turn on this disabler, which essentially turns off the car after how long a grace period?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what happens when the driver gets behind the wheel, inserts the key?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So do you use this disabler in all the cars you move off your lot or only in cases where you're dealing with someone you perceive to be a high-risk buyer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how often are you actually shutting cars down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, I guess this is good news for you. It allows you to keep in contact with someone who might be behind in their payments if they're ignoring your phone calls or your letters. Is it bad news, though, for the repo man? Are you trying to put him out of work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you had to think that some people are going to get tested and find that they're in a lower risk group and perhaps use these results as an excuse to keep smoking, don't you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Beyond that, there are some big ethical questions. Take insurance companies. If this test passes muster, could we be seeing high risk smokers paying more for their policies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Uh-huh. You know, stepping back from this test for just a moment, we'll soon have tests, it seems, for just about everything. What challenges does that present for ethicists?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your characters are often emotionally-fragile people who don't have a lot of self-awareness, and that leaves the reader looking at this person and feeling more powerful than the character and also slightly protective. Is that something you want the reader to feel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about the short story \"Mirrorball.\" Here's something that's again ubiquitous in American culture. A young couple gets together for a one-night stand.

What is at work in \"Mirrorball\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you read a little bit from \"Mirrorball\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, when I read your work, it seems as if the state of your character's mind is as concrete for you as hard tarmac at the airport. Is there any particular state of mind that you feel you couldn't capture or you don't want to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you feel that you're well-understood as a writer, or do you think that people mischaracterize you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, we're going to an uncertain time right now. A lot of people are feeling frail for various reasons. Do you think that's a scary subject in general for readers, fragility?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in other cases in which you've testified, similar questions or usually different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, is identification of a bird, is that now all DNA analysis or does it involve eyeballing remains and knowing that that is whatever?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the birds that the Guyanese take out to the park in New York, and you know, I suppose they're abusing the birds at one level, but it's a lot sweeter than cockfighting or something like that.

The best places in the country to try to reduce your tax bill?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did the government leaders say about the pirates to you? How do they regard these people? And do they consider them people who, given the right incentives and inducements, might be supporters of a government? Or are they simply outlaws?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But here's a question that's going to arise, in all likelihood, pretty soon. The Navy says that it will pursue the pirates where they live, which is ashore in towns in Somalia. Do you think the Somali authorities in Mogadishu, the government, could conceivably welcome that, or would they instinctively be against any foreign strike on Somali soil, even if it's against pirates, outlaws?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just one last question before I let you go. Do you think the American public has the patience for a mission that might sound like nation-building in Somalia or might sound like the kind of relief effort in the '90s that grew into the notorious Black Hawk Down incident?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Commentary from David Koen. He's a writer, an attorney in New Orleans. President Bush may be sending more troops to Iraq, but Britain is not. The British foreign secretary says today that her government has no plan to increase its forces. In fact, one British newspaper is describing a government timetable to withdraw nearly half Britain's troops from Iraq by the end of May. NPR's Rob Gifford is covering the story from London. And, Rob, is the coalition getting a little less willing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about President Bush' biggest ally in Europe, Tony Blair, the prime minister of Britain?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has Brown made it clear whether he would support a continuation of the war in any fashion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I think some people have compared the Massachusetts plan to car insurance - its basic idea - everybody has to have it. Is that right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Meaning that if you can afford it, you have to buy it. If you can't afford it and if the state pays for it, then you can do it. Is that right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So now as I understand it, Massachusetts is starting to put its health insurance plan into effect. How's it going?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How are you going to know if this thing is completely succeeding?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you also going to have to judge by insurance rates, because if everybody is insured, shouldn't that mean that other people's insurance rates should go down? I mean, the people who already had insurance, their rates should go down a little bit, or at least not rise as much?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if you had one piece of advice to give to other states, like California now, considering this plan, what would it be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the Iraqi government, does it have its own budget and how much has that been spent on reconstruction projects?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you say left unspent, meaning earmarked, not used, sitting on the bank waiting to be spent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Right. So it's not incompetence so much as, in a sense, red tape?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, early on, the Bush administration said that Iraq's oil revenues would pay for reconstruction. Clearly, that never happened, but is it even in sight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Bush is expected to announce a jobs program for Iraqis; does Iraq need a jobs program when it comes to its economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You had taken up the challenge in your work with the CIA of fighting al-Qaida. What is your view of what could be done with this threat?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " For five years now, the No Child Left Behind Law has required all schools to pay special attention to disadvantaged kids. And it puts pressure on your school to make sure that their scores improve, that their achievement improves. Has the federal law caused you to do things that you would not otherwise have done?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me just stop you for a second. What's AYP?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is the No Child Left Behind law providing with added resources to match the kind of demands that you're getting under this law?"}

Tens of thousands of Palestinians turned out yesterday in Gaza City for a rally in support of the Palestinian president. Mahmoud Abbas is struggling for power with the rival Hamas faction. And as we've been reporting in recent weeks, that struggle is violent. More than 30 Palestinians have been killed in factional fighting over the past month. NPR's Linda Gradstein is tracking the Palestinian division. She's in Jerusalem. And, Linda, what triggered these demonstrations in Gaza?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which of these two factions is actually in control in Gaza?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand there's a dispute over the Hamas security police. What's going on there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you've got two different security forces in effect, each of which claims to be official and is taking orders from different people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that make it harder for the Israeli government to try to make progress in its dealings with the Palestinian?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But for those of us who don't know how to count gigabytes and have no idea what a Skype conversation or some e-mail or YouTube amounts to, what kind of services are we talking about, and what would use the most bandwidth?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the company's rationale - are they losing money on big-time users?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But just to belabor the lunch analogy for a moment here, is the kitchen running out of food? That is, is there any pressure on these providers, if indeed one of us orders lobster and the other orders salad, and we pay the same?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And from what you know of the extent of different operations Navy SEALs have to train for, did this seem like a particularly difficult operation to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Kaj Larsen, paint a picture for us here of how this operation might look from the point of view of the rescuers. Some are on another ship. Are there frogmen in the water with guns? How does that all look?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods have just finished up. What's the news?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " In terms of food and water, what are the rations like? And how much fresh water do they have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how fresh is the water likely to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And are you able to stand up? What's your range of motion like inside?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it's hot. It smells terrible. You can't stand up. There's no ventilation. There's no head. It's bobbing up and down on high seas to an incredibly nauseating degree. The food is miserable. The water is just as bad. In theory, how long can they survive that way?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " (unintelligible) whether it's diesel, or biofuel, or gasoline, anything?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That does not automatically mean that people have to sacrifice, or conserve, or give up. Sometimes it can be something that people barely notice.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's stipulate that there are benefits, and stipulate that some of the changes are painless for some people. There, nevertheless, maybe people who are asked to change in ways that they find difficult. Are you prepared to push them on that? Even if that does mean some sacrifice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Senator, could you help set some expectations for us? Democrats are in control for the first time in a dozen years. You do have an administration of the other party, and a powerful minority there in the senate. How much can you really get down in the next two years?"}

Now, about a year ago, a year and a half ago, you're wading through the muck, doing whatever you do in the oyster world, and you read that there is this subprime mortgage crisis and that it's taking down investment firms and eventually banks.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, one of the things fans will notice about this album is that there's a lot of real instruments or samples of real instruments. Why don't you explain to me what you're doing there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do we hear on it? We hear a marimba. We heard a glockenspiel at some point, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Were the songs on this new album \"Bromst,\" were they a reaction to some of the critics who listened to your first album and said oh, you know, it's kind of clownish, it's wacky, it's, you know, cartoonish? Were you sort of responding to them in this album?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now when you go out to perform, are you going to bring live musicians?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of the ways it seems you're going to try and get around these challenges of a large band in recreating the album is, I read, you are going to distribute the sheet music to your album when you go to a city and invite people on stage. So how do you envision that working?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So now that you've moved from a one-man band to 15 musicians, any idea how big this can go? Do you think you'll be collaborating with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra next?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So does that mean that you will be dancing, in effect, right to that last breath?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Ford took over the presidency as the nation was trying to recover from Watergate. Did he, in fact, help heal the nation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Of course, conventional wisdom has it that his pardoning of Richard Nixon - his really first act - hurt the rest of Gerald Ford's political career, is that true?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, they certainly have this morning. It seems to be in all the headlines on the first few lines. The Vietnam War, though, also ended during his presidency, was that - what sort of legacy was that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would President, former President Gerald Ford have wanted to be remembered?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell us what happens when they continue with this brutal work schedule?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What possessed retailers to put on all these sales in November when they knew full well that December was coming up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what sold well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How bad is this for retailers? Can they recoup come the winter and the spring?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Ethiopian troops have been in Somalia for some time now, not fighting up until just now. Why are they suddenly on the attack?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, just, we'll talk about those other, those calls for other Islamists in a second, but is this the first time Ethiopia has admitted having troops in Somalia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Somalia hasn't had a functioning government for about 15 years, so this interim government is one that isn't highly respected and has virtually no power. But what exactly, when you talk about other Islamists into the country, what would that mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it's actually a series of three 20-minute concerts tonight, 2.50 each, what's on the program?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, is part of this sort of, you know, economic downturn pricing at all? Are we tying this into this economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Howard Herring is president of the New World Symphony. He was talking about their short format concerts tonight in Miami Beach. In professional sports, good players are a dime a dozen. Truly great ones are rare. So it's not often that a franchise trades a star just when he's getting to be a great performer, but that's what happened in the National Football League yesterday when the Denver Broncos traded 25-year-old quarterback Jay Cutler to the Chicago Bears. After spending a summer in uniform with the Broncos, our sports commentator Stefan Fatsis knows a little bit about the team, and he joins us now. Stefan - the trade of Jay Cutler is dominating sports section headlines all across the country today. Also, talked radio is just abuzz about this. Put this in some context for the more casual fan. Why is this such a big deal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Quite a list. So why was he traded?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now this sounds like a classic power struggle, a talented athlete, a high powered agent, a prominent team. Isn't this a big risk, though, for Denver Broncos, if you look at them just as a business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How has Turkey been hit in the current economic downturn?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The relationship between these two countries has been somewhat tense in recent years. Where have things gone wrong? And what does President Obama need to do to try to improve that relationship?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Asli, there's one issue that could play a bigger role here than any other: Armenia, and whether or not President Obama might throw his weight behind a congressional effort in this country to recognize the deaths of thousands of Armenians in 1915 as a genocide. What are the pitfalls for this president on that question?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Ford did ask the government for a credit line, but so far hasn't had to use it, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think - when you look at the status and where these three car companies are positioning themselves, what has Ford been able to do that GM and Chrysler haven't?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. Those were the days, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much of this has to do simply with car quality? I mean, can you make a case that Ford is in better shape maybe because it just makes better cars?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to ask you about the banking sector because in this country, the banks, the large banks are in rather bad odor because many people blame them for the current troubles in the economy. Could the same be said in Great Britain?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Obama is traveling to Europe hoping that world leaders will agree to this fiscal stimulus package, agree to spend a unified amount for an economic stimulus package. How likely is Prime Minister Gordon Brown to sign on to something like that? Is he likely to work in lockstep with other countries or peel off and go his own path?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And beyond that, is there sort of a different way of thinking in Great Britain where people have - don't have the same kind of safety net that people in other countries have, that there's less support for the unemployed, for instance?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this uptick in business largely due to the tax credit or are other factors at work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds like there's a little bit of confusion surrounding these tax credits. Do consumers really understand how they work? And did the government do a good sales job on its own, or did they leave that to companies like yours?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want you to help me clarify something, because a lot of times when people purchase windows, the purchase is actually made through a contractor. So, does the homeowner get the tax credit or does the contractor get the tax credit? And if it goes to the homeowner, how do they make sure that they get credit for it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, 180 workers are now back at work. When would you make a decision about when or how you might bring more employees back?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's certainly no secret that in the last 20, 25 years, longer incarceration rates and more prisons has been politically popular. In fact, no one could go wrong being tough on crime. What do you say to people who still feel strongly that that is the way to go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me talk about our own drug laws and the restructuring. You have a section in your bill that talks about restructuring the approach to the criminalization of illegal drugs. Could you tell me a few specifics?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Historically, punishment and rehabilitation have kind of swung back and forth in this country. In the 1960s, some concentration on rehabilitation. By 1980, an idea that certain people were never going to be rehabilitated. Do you believe that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, do you think there will be a fight over your bill? Do you expect a lot of opposition? And who will it be coming from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As I understand it, you're saying that solitary confinement is a hell hole, that it's torture. Why do you say that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, do you see this changing any time soon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What prompted you to write this article and take a look at solitary confinement?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When it was conceived, this meeting was called the New Bretton Woods, and that of course is a reference to the conference that reshaped the world's economic system after World War II. Are we at that moment now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, you know, not only that, but there comes something, another challenge to the dollar, and I'm not talking about the capital markets - the creation that China's proposing of a new international currency, something the Russians had tried to do. Is President Obama going to have to defend the very notion of the American dollar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me just make a quick point here. Malware is software with bad intent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, the people in the Dalai Lama's office brought this to your attention, and then what did you do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These spies were able to compromise hundreds of computers in more than 100 countries, correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has this spy network already had an effect on international relations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, have you ever seen Web espionage to this extent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what was it like to work with the late Jane Austen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you just introduce us to the zombies in the world of Elizabeth Bennet, please?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why's that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You could've chosen \"Wuthering Heights\" or George Eliot's \"The Mill on the Floss.\" Why did you pick \"Pride and Prejudice\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Elton John's production company, Rocket Pictures, has announced that it's working on a movie called \"Pride and Predator\" in which Longbourn is under attack by aliens. So I'm wondering which came first, your book or the film project?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you feel any trepidations about hearing from those of us who are former English literature majors calling you and saying, Seth, how dare you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Jacki Lyden. Big news in the struggling auto business today, reports that the chief executive of General Motors, Rick Wagoner, will resign. Wagoner has run the biggest of the big-three automakers for eight years. NPR's Frank Langfitt is with us now. Frank, we're seeing these reports. Does this look like it's really happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We just heard from our own newscasters that the White House might have asked him to step down. Do you know anything about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He had the support of Chrysler's board. What do you think the reaction is going to be to this in the broader auto industry?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Frank, do you think the White House is getting tougher with the auto industry?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've got three of the Final Four right now, and that third team is a bit of a surprise, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know what I like about March Madness is you get to hear about all these teams you haven't thought about and Cinderella stories, but this year no glass slippers. Why not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mike, put down that coffee cup and just tell me in a minute, the weekend's last game, you're watching from your own sofa. What do we know about who's going to win? How does it look?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Jacki Lyden. The images we've seen the last few days are striking: houses protected by makeshift dikes looking like islands separated by a frozen sea. There is good news today for the folks battling to save their homes along the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota. The National Weather Service says the river may have crested and won't rise as high as previously thought. To start today's show, we'll talk to several people along the river. First up, NPR's David Schaper. You're on a bridge, David, between Fargo, North Dakota, and Moorhead, Minnesota. How's it look from there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the operation look like now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you remind us, David, how this flooding all got started?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Floodwaters will subside eventually, and the Red River will drop. So, what happens to the millions of sandbags spread out over Fargo?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Leon Schlafmann is the emergency management director in Fargo, North Dakota. Evan Wright has become known as the new gonzo journalist, a guy who really puts himself out there, or as one editor put it, unofficial ambassador to the underbelly. He cemented that reputation with his national bestseller, \"Generation Kill.\" In that book, the former editor at Hustler magazine embedded with a platoon of Marines in Iraq. He's got a new book coming out, and what's it called, Evan Wright?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And that means?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what happened in that first interview in the offices of Hustler?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The most autobiographical article in this collection is \"Scenes from My Life in Porn,\" and this is about your experiences writing for Hustler, and you said you probably never used the word woman when you wrote all this copy about them. What was that like, having to sort of bend descriptions of the female into things that were so objectified?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Extreme alienation is a phrase that you use to describe some of the people that you write about in \"Hella Nation.\" What do you think sets them apart from the average alienated typical person?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, if this makes you unofficial ambassador to the underbelly, do you think you'd ever write about Main Street?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The prime minister is talking about revising the 1701 Act of Settlement. Is it really time yet to do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now on to the other issue - the gender preference. Let's say that there were no automatic preference in favor of a male heir. How would that, say, upset the current line of succession to the throne?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Suddenly it's very cheap to buy a mortgage, is that a great sign, cause for a celebration over at the White House?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you say it's a ridged game, what is the government doing to force mortgage rates low?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It means the Fed is running a pump and dump scandal here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, for many years mortgage rates have been lower because China and other foreign governments have bought huge amounts of U.S. debt. Are they still doing that, and should we worry that perhaps they might stop?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is anybody authoritative offering some measure of how far along the road toward recovery we can now say the economy is?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Back in November George Packer of the New Yorker quoted you as saying about the war in Afghanistan: It is still winnable but only just. It's four months later, would you say the say the same thing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if you could describe in essence the conceptual shift that would have to be made in Afghanistan, beyond simply sending more forces there in order to make it winnable, what is that shift?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The title of your book, \"Accidental Guerilla,\" suggests why small wars may be winnable. \"Accidental Guerilla\" is a way of describing someone who, we're more accustomed to hearing nowadays as a militant or a murderer or terrorist, a person of unshakable faith in some violent broad cause. You're not describing that kind of person. You're describing somebody who - if things were little different in their neck of the woods, wouldn't be a guerilla at all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell me some things that the United States could do in Afghanistan - or do more of - that it's not doing now, that would operate in that direction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Should we assume that the war in Afghanistan remains a long war for a long time, and that whatever we do now is a 10, 15 year proposition, not a 2 to 5 year proposition?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just to make sure there is no - there is no confusion in your point here. As far as you are concerned, it is still vital to get out the al-Qaeda leadership somewhere in tribal Pakistan or mountains of Afghanistan wherever they might be at this moment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " David Kilcullen is a former adviser to General David Petraeus. He is the author of \"The Accidental Guerrilla\" and he's also a partner in the Crompton Group, a Washington based strategy firm and a senior fellow with the Centre for New American Security. Oh, let's check in with another holiday traveler - Russian President Vladimir Putin. He's making his first visit in two years to the neighboring country of Ukraine. And his trip is a sign that relations may be warming slightly. No pun intended, because relations were much worse a year ago when Moscow shut off natural gas supplies during a bitter winter cold spell. Let's go to NPR's Gregory Feifer, who is covering this story. Gregory, the last time that Putin visited Ukraine, the political situation was very different. How have things changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Although let's talk about the two presidents here. Yushchenko, who you mentioned, was poisoned, apparently, during his campaign for office a couple of years ago. Moscow was against him. Moscow was suspected of some kind of involvement in the poisoning. Are these two presidents actually going to meet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Gregory, in a moment we're going to talk more about Turkmenistan - the president who died, and a gas-rich republic, and what that means for the region. But first, let's talk about Russia. Very briefly, how powerful are they because they're such a big energy exporter to so much - so many of their neighbors?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He changed his name to Turkmenbashi to reflect that he was - what? What does that mean - the father of the Turks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Turkmen. Turkmen. And his picture was everywhere; it was that kind of dictatorship?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And his country's energy was everywhere under the ground. What are the implications of his sudden death?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You think there are some Western oil companies that might be hoping for a ruler that is a little bit easier to deal with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hey, could you just explain how it happened that Iverson has been on the bench the last couple of weeks in Philadelphia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about some of what they've been through together. Allen Iverson is obviously a brilliant player, but with a little bit of a reputation. What is that reputation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was that practice rant?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Human rights groups have called this entire case a miscarriage of justice. Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But why is Libya insisting on pursuing this case? What would be the political motivation for Libya to pursue a case like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now that they've been found guilty for a second time in a new trial and sentenced to death, what happens?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how are Mr. Paulson's accomplishments being received by China's Congress? Do you know that yet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it possible that the treasury secretary would use the new Democratic and critical Congress as some sort of negotiating tool with China?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what happens next in his strategic economic dialogue - I'm quoting there, that's the term he would use - with China?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you expect any kind of a breakthrough in this new round of talks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well as we just said, 13 months ago - back September, 2005 - North Korea agreed, in principle, to abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for security guarantees and aid from the United States. Where does that agreement stand as of the beginning of these talks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " North Korea has complained about what it sees as the hostile policy of the United States. It's demanding an end to U.S. financial restrictions. What does North Korea have to do to make this happen, as far as the United States is concerned?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The U.S. is meeting directly with North Korea today, I believe. What will those bilateral talks be about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you expect to get out of that that would be different than with all six nations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These talks are open-ended with North Korea. Are you going to get home for Christmas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You cite sources who are two State Department officials that had, as you describe it, intimate knowledge of Holbrooke's activities. What did they say exactly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, was he actually ever in a position to offer a firm guarantee of immunity to Radovan Karadzic?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Professor Ingrao, reading about this, I can't help but wonder, which is better, to offer immunity to some global villain, if that might help put an end to a war, or say - as we've seen recently in Sudan related to Darfur - issue an arrest warrant that no one is actually able or willing to serve, and it may actually exacerbate the plight of the victims in the short term?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Ingrao, when you say that your sources for this didn't want to go on the record by name because of concerns about their work, you seem to be - you sound like a journalist, not like a historian there. This is a kind of sourcing that people in my line of work are accustomed to, but wouldn't we expect of you some documents, something a little bit harder than those accounts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You would look upon these securities that you could buy under this program as being as safe and secure as Treasury bonds, Treasury bills?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me ask you about something which you just said. They could go for 40, 50, 60 cents on the dollar, that's a pretty big spread there. How will you figure out whether one of these securities is worth bidding 44 or is worth bidding 60 cents for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you at all concerned that if Pimco were to buy these securities and discovered that indeed it has gotten such a good price that it made very good money on them over the next couple of years, that the Congress would come back and tax your earnings or tax the bonuses that are paid out of that money?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One thing I don't understand is this, though. I understand how this would be a win for a fund manager like Pimco, if it became involved. I understand how it could be a win for a bank that could get some toxic securities off its books that have been holding it back, how is it a win for taxpayers if the taxpayers are indeed paying for the difference of what these are said to be worth and what they really might be worth?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Since indeed these are toxic assets - these are not Treasury, these are not ordinary Treasury bills. Is there any down side at all for Pimco here or you guarantee that you just can't lose a nickel on these things?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You couldn't lose more than 100 percent of what you put in at the beginning, could you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Once again, the big story today was the Obama administration's plan to get the so-called toxic assets off the books of the banks that bought them, and one place where that plan got rave reviews is the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow went up today by nearly 500 points. That's almost a seven percent gain, which means that it must have been a big day for Ted Weisberg of Seaport Securities, who is a floor trader at the Exchange and a frequent guest here. What was it like today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, was it all the Geithner plan, or was it other news?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does that say to you? Does it say that this is about atmospherics and a broad sense of optimism, or does it say that there are real indicators about the real economy of the country, which suggests perhaps the markets were undervaluing them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " William Wordsworth's relationship with his sister was as interwoven and complicated as any two siblings could share. And Dorothy's journals about that time, called the \"Grasmere Journals,\" are considered a British literary treasure. Writer Frances Wilson has analyzed those journals, and the result is her new book, \"The Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth.\" She says Dorothy and William were separated at a young age after their mother died. And when they were reunited?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to pick up on a couple of the themes that you just expressed in a moment, but let's talk about William Wordsworth's poem, \"Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey,\" a beautiful abbey in England. It gives us a sense of Dorothy's importance to him. Would you read a few of the lines, beginning with the words: For thou art with me?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wild eyes. How would you describe the Dorothy Wordsworth of the \"Grasmere Journals\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " To Wordsworth, of course, she's a great inspiration, and not just to him, but they have frequent visits from the poet, Samuel Coleridge. There's one journal entry I love that have Dorothy and William pretending to lie in a grave. Would you tell us that story?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to one of her best friends, Mary Hutchinson, and she does sleep with William's wedding ring on her finger the night before. Would you describe what you think is going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are we to cast that as excessive emotional intimacy, or was that the mores of the day, or were they simply eccentric?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of bread are we going to make?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you know if this dough is ready?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, let's start with those AIG bonuses. The U.S. House moved to impose heavy taxes on them last week, as we know. Where is that likely to go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm, a controversial move. And Tom, here's another one. The government's boldest action this week had to be the Federal Reserve decision to spend up to a trillion dollars buying up U.S. Treasury bonds and other securities. Any indication what impact that move could have on top of the other things we've seen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But when you create money like that, isn't there always a risk of inflation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've heard a lot about Starbucks trying to combat its image as the $4-cup-of-coffee company, and one of the things it's fighting back with is a discount breakfast-and-coffee deal, among other things. But I was wondering, is there a danger of going too far, in a way, that sort of cheapens or takes the mystique off the brand?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of messages can we expect as long as the recession lasts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about where companies are spending their marketing dollars now. Where are they spending them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you see companies moving back to their old strategies, or do you think this kind of direct targeting is going to be a permanent change?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm. These were a bit scary. Would you tell us what they were?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about the brain-age test. You felt pretty competitive going into that. What is the brain-age test?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I, however, was a damsel of 36, and I was eating salad. What was it like to spend 22 hours inside MRI machines?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Most of us won't be able to do this many tests. Some of them were in experimental stages. What should we learn from the way that testing is improving so rapidly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here's a sign of the times, the symbol of how things have changed in Iraq -western tourists are there on a two-week visit, the first group of western tourists to travel throughout Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Five Britons, two Americans and a Canadian have been visiting historic sites around the country. Tina Townsend Greaves of Yorkshire, England is on the Mesopotamia tour. She joins us from Baghdad. And Ms. Greaves, it sounds like you've been all over, from the Kurdish north, all the way down to Basra in the south. What are some of the highlights for you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, have you been concerned about security, safety while you're there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you feel like you've been able to get any real sense of daily life in Iraq in this trip?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of reaction do you get?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has anybody said, we think you're crazy, you might be a Little premature?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the Iraqi tourism ministry has said that it expects your group to convey a positive message to folks back home that the situation in Iraq is good. As you head home this weekend, is that your message? What do you take from all this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, given that we're in the midst of a lot of talk about what makes the most sense, are there any recommendations on Iraq from the Iraq Study Group, from the administration, Democrats, that you think are unacceptable?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Bush has said now that he'll be waiting until January to announce any new strategy on Iraq. As increasingly chaotic and bloody as Iraq is day by day, is that too late?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, given the levels of support for the Iraq war among the American people, and how that support is going down, politically speaking, does the president have this much time to act?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. So for the taxpayer who does not own a home or isn't in the market for a new car, what are some general last minute tips?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Saudi Arabia is a major Sunni country, and it's argued strongly against a U.S. pullout from Iraq, as we've said. How significant is this warning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Shiites, it would be worried, would somehow be emboldened by Iran having more influence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well let's turn to Iran. And in turning to Iran, let's turn to Syria, because in some sense they are together in their response to this. The Iraq Study Group suggested direct talks with both countries on Iraq security. Do Iran and Syria have common goals when it comes to Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mean in a sense, Iran and also Syria are gambling on something you might call controlled chaos in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And these people are coming from not just Afghanistan and Pakistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, just to be clear, the threat is what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We began this conversation by speaking of a Taliban mini-state. What would its goal be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thank you very much. Carlotta Gall of the New York Times, speaking from Kandahar, Afghanistan. The dictator who once ruled Chile is dead. On the streets of the capital you could find everything from champagne to teargas. Augusto Pinochet died at age 91, a week after suffering a heart attack. He was known for a military coup, which did not stop supporters from singing his name over the weekend. Unidentified Group: (Singing) Pinochet, Pinochet. Ole, ole, ole, ole. Nathan Crooks is editor of the English language daily, The Santiago Times, and he's on the line from Santiago. Mr. Crooks, what was it like walking through the streets of Santiago last night?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How were the water canons used, and against whom?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Will you explain why there is a pro-Pinochet crowd in this country, given the man's record that's been criticized around the world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Crooks, I feel obliged to try to get the man's name right, here in death. We've been saying Pinochet here in the United States. You're there in Santiago, Chile, and saying Pinochet. How did he say it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. Now what are the funeral plans for the ex-president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it seem at all that the president got away with a military coup, with being a dictator, with the murders of which he's accused - because in the end he was not brought to trial, he was not put in prison?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let me just point out that Lexus, Toyota and Mercury rounded out the top five on that J.D. Powers survey. How did they actually figure this out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I just want to ask you about another survey, Consumer Reports happens to be also out with its auto issue right now. And we took a look at their reliability ratings, and they apparently didn't have enough 2006 Jaguars in their survey to report on that model year, but Buicks, according to their survey, looked to be pretty average. And there's one in particular, the Terraza, that apparently, according to their respondents, was a real lemon. What do you make about the - what do you make of the difference there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it that the auto industry doesn't do a good job of telling its own story - that vehicles are much improved?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Warren Brown is an automotive columnist for The Washington Post. We have been hearing a lot about rage about the huge bonuses that AIG gave to executives, but there are some who say that outrage is misdirected. They say more outrageous are the billions of dollars in taxpayer money that AIG is using to pay its counterparties, that is, banks and other institutions. NPR's Adam Davidson is part of our Planet Money team. He's been studying AIG and he joins me now. Adam, please remind us how this works. Why is AIG paying these so-called counterparties all this money?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Adam, the people who are outraged say that the money that the government is paying to AIG is actually some sort of secret bailout for these counterparties, these other huge banks. You've been covering this a long time, is that the way you see this? Why would AIG give money that it received from the U.S. government to these counterparties and make these payouts at 100 cents on the dollar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, a lot of people are interested in who was on the receiving end, or what companies were on the receiving end of these AIG payments. What do we know about that list?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that troublesome or should that be troublesome?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And professor, there have been worries of this protest. If it happened today, could have led to bloody confrontations with the authorities, then this dramatic turnaround, by the president. How do you explain his reversal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm hmm. And do you think in the end, this leaves President Zardari, who's only been in power for less than a year, does it leave him substantially weakened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about the opposition movement? I mean, does this satisfy their demands or will there be further demands to come?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. And you mentioned the opposition leader Nawaz Sharif who had been exiled, returned to Pakistan. He told supporters this weekend, from here, God willing, the fate of this nation will change. From here a revolution will come. What kind of revolution do you think he is talking about there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So kind of an extraordinary turnaround and a dramatic day. What happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has the government said anything about all this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Annie, it sounds as though at the moment, things are calm, though caravans set out for Islamabad for a rally there tomorrow. What's supposed to happen next?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Annie, what tomorrow's sit-in is supposed to be about is the reinstatement of the former chief justice of Pakistan, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So have roads to Islamabad been blocked, to your knowledge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, one character, young Billy Poe, sums it up the best. He's just barely out of his teens. He says you ought to be able to grow up in a place and not have to get the hell out of it when you turn 18. Why did you set your story in a place that was decaying like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, why does Billy Poe want to stay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " \"American Rust\" is told from six different perspectives, six major players. Some of these people want to leave Buell, others don't. There's a whole range of hopes and aspirations, and I thought that the most complex character was the police chief, Bud Harris(ph). Would you tell me about him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to ask you, though, you did spend quite a bit of time in the Mon Valley talking to a lot of people. You credit the Mon Valley Unemployed Committee. What did the people that you spoke to as you were researching this book tell you about their dreams?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, you came along in 2001. By that time, what did it look like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If I were to get a sandwich, if I were to want to eat lunch in Braddock, could I do that in a restaurant?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So why did you decide to move to the city, make a stand and run for mayor?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I wanted to ask you about that. One of the comments I read or heard was you saying that if you couldn't attract new residents and new growth then you are basically failing at your efforts. So, have you been able to do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what's a typical day for a mayor on the urban homesteading front?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So are you going to raise Carl Fetterman in Braddock?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mark, tell us how carefully the detention of Abu Zubaydah, who you say was a test case for the other detainees who would follow him, was coordinated by the CIA and the White House. How much knowledge was there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did you get the document?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Bush stated on more than one occasion, that the United States does not torture. Does this suggest that, in fact, that's an untruth?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's be frank about the downside here. Mississippi has low rankings for education, for health, for income. What are people missing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's talk about these advertisements that you have put together here. I'm looking at one. It's got a bunch of photographs on it of famous people - Tennessee Williams, Willie Morris; well-known authors here - William Faulkner, Eudora Welty. What are you trying to say here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me ask about this poster that has pictures of native Mississippians Oprah Winfrey, Elvis Presley, Faith Hill, Jim Henson, James Earl Jones and several others. What's the slogan here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're in the Syrian capital. What's been the reaction there to the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, that is the investigation that is being run by the United Nations into the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister, and Syria has been implicated in that assassination. In the Iraq Study Group, that is off the table. That is not to be part of this discussion if the U.S. offers talks. What can Syria offer to the United States on Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How concerned is Syria about instability in Iraq right next door?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And quickly, what are Arab allies - Saudi Arabia, Egypt - saying about a new U.S. dialogue with the Syrians, and how will that play in Washington?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's not a surprise to customers, this critical mass of breaking. So why did you decide to take it on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what are the most common problems?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You managed to get released on bail, but you could be incarcerated again. What were the terms of your release?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We know that Prime Minister Tsvangirai, the leader of the opposition party, the MDC, was recently the victim of a suspicious car accident in which his wife was killed. Have you visited him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any more word among government officials about the cause of the accident?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, let's take a look at this. Why does this accounting rule matter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wow, it sounds like a little, sleeping, ticking time bomb. Could you please explain it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, who is coming around to the banking industry's position?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, now we're going to talk with one of the people who was in court today, one of the investors who lost money with Bernard Madoff. Ronnie Sue Ambrosino is a retiree from Delray Beach, Florida. And Ms. Ambrosino, you and your husband, Dominic, lost how much money with Madoff?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In your case, for how many years did you have money with Madoff?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, thank you very much. By the way, I mean, how are you and your husband doing right now? I mean, without the money, how is it changing your plans about what you're doing in your lives?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what you heard from them is accessible. What did you find?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " but also to spend to get the economy moving. I want to know, when you spoke to people about the changes they're making in their lives, first of all, what sorts of things are they cutting back on or not spending on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which did you find to be more true, I'm curious, Debbie, that people regard this as the way it's going to be from now on? Things have changed. Or this is a tough stretch that we'll have to get through, and we'll have the organic strawberries and the spring break in a couple of years, but just not this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There were some senators, Joseph Lieberman, Charles Schumer of New York who evidently were against your nomination. Were you told, by the way, that your nomination would be blocked, or did the White House or the director of National Intelligence tell you that this was a lost cause, you'd better withdraw?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But while you say you would've been subjected to criticism yesterday, the director of National Intelligence, Dennis Blair, testified in support of you on Capitol Hill. Some retired ambassadors like Samuel Lewis and Thomas Pickering, publicly supported your pick. I guess one question is, so what if you'd be criticized by some people? Why not fight it out and say, I know what I'm doing, and the president has asked me to do this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's start with the games that will help decide a national champion. We know Ohio State is in the title game, they're ranked number one. But who's the most likely opponent?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " John, you wrote a book about the Army-Navy rivalry, what is it about this game that's so special?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what sparked this report and what's the problem that's been identified?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, is it really a problem, or did they just start with the conclusion and try to reduce regulation as business always wants to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This report is sort of a response to complaints from business, about this Sarbanes-Oxley legislation that came after Enron, to clamp down on business. Is this essentially an attempt to roll it back?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is it likely these recommendations are going to get adopted?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Pope Benedict today begins a four-day visit to Turkey, a visit he hopes will open a dialogue between Christians and Muslims. At the outset of his trip, the pope spoke of the need for reconciliation between religions and cultures. He's also hoping to mend the 1,000-year-old rift between the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity. This is the pope's first visit to a Muslim country, and the most difficult mission of his papacy. It follows, by two months, controversial comments he made about Islam. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is in Istanbul and she joins us now. And Sylvia, the pope has now had his first face-to-face meeting with Turkish leaders, and that includes religious leaders. What happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I just said that it was this pope's most difficult mission, but it's actually being looked at as one of the most difficult Papal trips in modern times. What's at stake?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the Vatican and the Turkish government have separate sets of expectations. What are they, from this visit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as you said, the original purpose of this visit is a search for Christian unity. I gather the pope will pray together with the patriarch of the world's Orthodox Christians. How deep is the rift, is it healable?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, since you have performed and you've been - you've won the competition, what are you going to play for us right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lloyd Mager, again, your day job in Key West?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how does one get out, provided that the prisoner is, you know, not misbehaving and just wants to get into general population?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The whole notion of the supermax was that it was supposed to make the rest of the prison population safer. Is there any evidence of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were the Wisconsin state secretary of corrections in the mid-1980s, and that was around the time that the crack cocaine epidemic swept the country. The prevailing thinking very much began to be lock them up, if not throw away the key, lose it for a good long while. Are we starting to move away from that attitude?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But they weren't paraded through the streets, I gather. What does that amount to, though? Does this mean throwing out the young reformers and reinstating the old guard or throwing out the old guard and bringing in reformers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How old is Raul Castro?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Fidel Castro issued a statement after Raul made his move, Tom, saying that Raul had consulted him. How much of a role do you think Fidel actually played here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think it's a sign, Tom, that Raul is moving out from under his brother's shadow and setting himself up president for life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tom, there's been speculation that the election of Barack Obama might bring about better relations between Washington and Havana. Does this shakeup give any indication of how Raul Castro might relate to the United States?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Introduce us to Lowboy. Who is he, and why has he brought Emily, his quasi-girlfriend, down into the subway?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your novel unfolds during the course of a single day, and the plot is one of pursuit, of Lowboy trying to carry out his master plan before the authorities can stop him. What's the relationship between the style, the sort of staccato way, that talking the thriller style and the state of schizophrenia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was it what you heard in mental hospitals that gave you the impetus for writing about schizophrenia like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you actually wrote this book, unbelievably, while you were riding the subway or big chunks of it while you were riding the subway?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As you were doing this method writing, is there anybody who stood out particularly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's such a wide imagination that Lowboy has, and you really had empathy because you know he's hearing voices, seeing things other people don't see. Lowboy poses one question over and over. He says, why was I born? And at one point, he says to his girlfriend, there has to be a reason, Emily, otherwise why this sickness?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, this really isn't Soundgarden. It's like a modern soul record. How did the project get started?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm talking to singer Chris Cornell. His new CD is called \"Scream.\" Now, many R&B singers had great screams themselves: James Brown, Otis Redding, Sam & Dave. Do you feel your style has something in common with theirs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Timbaland had you change your singing style completely. How difficult was that to do after 20 years of singing in a different way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you braced, Chris Cornell, for a little resistance from your old Soundgarden fans? I mean, this isn't necessarily a sound that all of them will wrap their arms around, is it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what do you say to them to convince them to come along on your fans (unintelligible)?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, as we heard throughout his campaign, candidate Obama took some heat for saying that he'd be willing to talk to America's enemies and certainly, the Taliban would qualify there. Does this change U.S. policy in Afghanistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did the president outline what next steps he will take to determine if this is a strategy the American military will move forward with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sticking with foreign policy for just another moment, Sheryl, administration officials were critical of Pakistan for the actions that it's taken to reach out to some in the Taliban. So, how would the American strategy be different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was the president's overall tone as regards Afghanistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, Turkey's an interesting choice to end it. What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Turkey mediating indirect talks last year between Israel and Syria. So, the secretary's already sent envoys to Syria, Michele. Any news from these people? Who are they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another interesting relationship, to say the least, the Obama administration seems to be following up on the campaign promises made to talk to Iran. It's come up a lot on this trip. In Brussels, Secretary Clinton proposed a major conference on Afghanistan. She said that Iran would be invited to that conference, but she's also had some tough words for the Islamic republic. Michele, how would you characterize her position?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, as if we needed more confirmation that we're deeply into a recession, the S&P 500 this week reached lows not seen since 1996. And we did have what looked like a rally going on Wednesday, but it didn't last. Why not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, down below the ATM fee. Watching the news crawl across the TV screen today, listening to our own reportage, this week has really felt almost like a war week with breaking news, different fronts. What does a week like this mean for the Obama administration's efforts to deal with the crisis?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it ridiculous to ask you if there's any good news?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I was sitting at my computer with a text-to-speech program open, and I type in a sentence - let's say, hello, I'm Jacki Lyden. What happens then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Four phonemes. What are they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So last week, as we noted, Roy Blount and the Authors Guild complained about the text to speech on the Kindle 2 and Amazon, in turn, agreed to let individual authors decide whether or not they wanted that feature to be used for their books, the text to speech. We got our hands on a Kindle 2, and we had the machine read to us a little bit. This is from the book \"The Best and The Brightest,\" by David Halberstam. Unidentified Voice #2: (Reading) Then they spoke of defense, a glandular thing, love it said, a monstrosity. Even talking about it damaged a man's stomach. Doesn't exactly have a whole lot of range, that human dramatic emotion, does it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand that you are working, Andy, on text to speech systems that can express different emotions. You sent us two examples of computer speech, old and new. Let's play them and then talk about the differences. Unidentified Voice #3: These cookies are delicious. Unidentified Voice #4: These cookies are delicious. How did you do that? How did that change?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And just stick a note on it, really, saying, sorry I can't pay this right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you are paying late, will you be charged penalties and interests?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to start putting some questions to you that were sent in by our listeners when they heard you were coming to pay us a visit. And a lot of them reflect the economic times we're in. Here's a question from listener Homer Williams. He's writing from Reading, Pennsylvania, and here's what he says: Like most people, my IRA has tanked. It is now worth less than my original contributions. In ordinary times, I have to pay taxes on the earning as I withdraw from it. With the loss, when can I deduct the loss? What is the answer to that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We got a question from listener Javier Ochoa(ph) of Scottsdale, Arizona, and he asks this: I'm currently unemployed. After I was let go, I had to convert my 401(k) to a rolled-over IRA, which means I can't borrow against it like I would be able to if it were still a 401(k). He says, money is tight and I'm struggling to keep my household going until I get my next job. How do I pull money out while minimizing my penalties and taxes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to move on to a question from a listener, Lauren Rogers(ph) of Sterling, Virginia. And she writes to say that in 2008, she bought a foreclosed townhouse - probably a lot of people in that position right now. We are looking at taking advantage of the $7,500 tax credit. Ms. Rogers wants to know, are there any other tax advantages or benefits that we should be looking at as first-time home buyers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We got a, sort of, more global question from listener Jim Huddleston in Lawrence, Kansas. And he says that he read that the IRS is not collecting about $300 billion a year, and that the entire stimulus package could be paid for in three years if the effort was made to collect. And he says, why don't you do it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So that's reported directly to you, or will be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I think that $300 billion number actually understates the tax gap. Am I right on this? That the IRS estimate from 2001 was that the gap between what you're owed and what you collected is - what, $345 billion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The novels are \"Infinity in the Palm of Her Hand\" and \"The Frozen Thames.\" Our reviewer is Alan Cheuse. Here in Washington, we're still thawing out from winter, but there are signs of spring in the deserts of California. Wildflowers are blooming and that's bringing throngs of wildflower enthusiasts to Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. It's about two hours east of San Diego. It's the only time of year the park sees many visitors, so Gail Sevrens tries to make the most of it. She works with volunteers and visitors there and she joins us now from Anza-Borrego. Gail Sevrens, what's blooming right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This desert five-spot - what's that look like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned the desert five-spot. The desert five-spot is elusive. How elusive - how big a find is it, to have it this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ms. Sevrens, do you have a favorite?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what you're saying is the federal government created an unregulated space for credit default swaps and other kinds of derivatives to be traded in. If it had wanted to regulate, is it something that a national government can actually do, or are we looking at such a global market of credit default swaps and other kinds of investments that there has to be some still higher authority to regulate these things?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The traditional insurance businesses of AIG that you regulate in New York, they're healthy. They're actually sound insurance companies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Those numbers check out to you? Even as this much federal money goes into AIG, you think that AIG's assets can actually satisfy all of that bad debt?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Eric Dinallo, who is the insurance commissioner of New York State. It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. Baghdad is under indefinite curfew again today. The airport is also closed, part of the response to a series of car bombings. The attacks came yesterday in the section known as Sadr City and killed more than 200 people. And all the security efforts did not stop another car bombing today in northern Iraq. NPR's Jamie Tarabay is covering this story in Baghdad. We say there's a curfew in Baghdad, what does that mean for people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have people gotten to the point where they stockpile food and supplies because they can expect curfews from time to time like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jamie Tarabay, we're speculating here, but I'd like to ask about it. Is it believed in Baghdad, that whoever is behind these car bombings is sophisticated enough that they would say, Thanksgiving is coming in the United States - slow news day - let's do a major attack on that day and it will dominate the news in the United States all day long, which in fact it did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The way that we cover ourselves - what do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. In the wake of yesterday's attacks, Jamie, do American and Iraqi officials agree on what to do and how to approach the security situation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Commentary from Steve Case, who's a youth minister with the United Church of Christ in Florida. From NPR News, this is MORNING EDITION. It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. This is the day that Lebanon is burying one more of its political leaders. Pierre Gemayel is the Lebanese cabinet minister killed this week in a Beirut street. And if that story sounds familiar, it's because it's the latest in a string of political assassinations. Gemayel's supporters turned out in masses for his funeral and they say that he was killed for his anti-Syrian views. Syria has denied involvement. Let's go now to NPR's Peter Kenyon, is in Beirut. And Peter, what have you seen on the streets today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And just to be clear on who's on what side, and I know that is unclear in some cases, you have Lebanon's government, which has been installed just in the last year, year and a half, and you have Hezbollah, which has allied with Syria, and Syria is being blamed for this assassination. What was the mood of people on the streets as the coffin itself was carried through?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Peter, this government still faces some of the same problems that it had before the killing. Are people concerned about what happens next?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's talk about that separate issue of interrogation. Of course, you in the Senate and the House have legislated on this just very recently and adjusted the rules somewhat having to do with harsh interrogations. Do you believe that torture - or what you would define as torture - has produced useful information?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You think that there are techniques that are beyond ordinary police questioning but short of torture that can be employed legally. Is that what you're saying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When it comes to questions like warrantless wiretapping or harsh questioning, do you think you're really that far apart from the Bush administration?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that your biggest difference with the administration right now, is how much Congress is allowed to know and how much Congress is allowed to question and participate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The two envoys who have been sent are Jeffrey Feltman and Dan Shapiro. What can you tell us about that selection?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Talking about being on that same page - on that page what the U.S. and Syria have to talk about are just about everything in the region - Iraq, Iran, nuclear proliferation, Israel. What do you think is at the top of the agenda for the U.S.?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were in Syria not too long ago. Did you get the impression that a dialogue with the United States is something that the Syrians would attach a great deal of value to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that mean he's about to pay back $10 billion very soon to the Treasury?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now another problem with Bank of America's purchase of Merrill Lynch was that it turned out Merrill was paying out a few billion in bonuses - not to mention millions in bathroom redecorating costs - just as it was losing even more billions. Does Ken Lewis express any regret over the very idea of buying Merrill Lynch?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " still look that way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And your story and the interview with Kenneth Lewis is in tomorrow's Financial Times?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, we've learned the big-dollar amounts in the defense budget, but does that tell us much about how exactly the Pentagon's going to spend the money?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But we do know that even though the budget went up, the Pentagon has to cut back programs. Why is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, describe to me your greenhouse. That's where you're standing right now. What would we see if we could look in on you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you joined the military, is this how you thought your career would go? I mean, did you think you would come out and start your own business of any sort, or did you think you would get a job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a way in which farming's a good fit for you as an ex-military person?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, you know, I've seen the ads for the military and for the Marines, and there's this implicit promise, or at least there was, that you would be eligible for high-tech careers afterwards. You would be able to manage people in large firms, and they do teach those skills, but I guess what no one expected that they would face this kind of economy when they left the military. So what have you been hearing from some of the other people who you served with? Are many of them starting their own businesses? Are they finding work out there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So several U.S. government agencies, including the CIA, have said that this drug war is so out of control that it might even lead to the collapse of the Mexican state. I mean, how probable is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But is this limited to just a few regions of Mexico?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, people's nerves are clearly frayed, and not just in these cities but in the governments, too. I mean, as we heard on Friday, the U.S. government basically said that they blamed corruption in Mexican government for the slowness of dealing with this problem. And then, President Calderon came back and complained that the U.S. hasn't been doing enough to curb demand for drugs and stem the flow of weapons south of the border. So does that criticism hold up?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you and I spoke last year, W.R. Grace had just agreed to a record settlement to pay for some of the cleanup that you just mentioned. In this criminal case against the company, what does the government have to prove?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's W.R. Grace's defense?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do they have to clear the account all at once? Or do they have six months to do this before they get the $300 payment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. Now, Amex says they're doing this to reduce the risk or future defaults. Does that explanation makes sense to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So American Express is offering, essentially, a carrot - a $300 carrot - to move potentially troubled accounts off their docket. What are other companies doing to shed troubled accounts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are they also raising interest rates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do these credit card companies decide which customers get a rate hike? Are they only raising interest rates for customers with late payments?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, is Louisiana's economy strong enough to turn down all that cash, $100 million?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the unemployment rate in Louisiana right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if the governor is rejecting this money in part because he doesn't feel that he needs the money for unemployment assistance, what about the overall health of the economy - because that determines how many people in the state will eventually have to tap into those funds. Is the state of the economy strong right now despite the economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Jindal says that he's planning on rejecting money in the stimulus package that would be used for unemployment assistance. But what about money in the stimulus package that would go for infrastructure projects, rebuilding roads or even levies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a bit of irony here that the state is perhaps better positioned economically because of all the money it received from the federal government following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, that it might be better able to ride out this economic storm because of the money it received after those storms years ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jim Richardson is a professor of economics, and he's also the director of the Public Administration Institute at Louisiana State University A visitor from the outer edge of the solar system should be visible in the night sky this week. It is Comet Lulin, discovered less than two years ago. And tonight the comet will be at its closet point to Earth, about 38 million miles away. Kelly Beatty had been watching Comet Lulin approach. He's senior contributing editor of Sky and Telescope magazine. Kelly, is it putting on a good show?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, well, where and when should we look?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it's said to have a tail and an anti-tail. What's that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The first time coming by?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Kelly, if we want to get out there and try to find Comet Lulin, how much more time do we have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can you tell us about these meetings today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh, it has absolutely refused to speak to Iran or Syria directly. Will President Bush go along with this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, there have been many ideas about how to deal with Iraq that have been floated out there for months now and the real failing situation over there. Why do you think the Iraq Study Group is so important now and might be coming up with ideas that say, you might not have thought the president would countenance even a short while ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is your organization's reaction to the secretary of state's stance on China's human-rights record?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what the secretary said is - Mrs. Clinton said is, we know we're going to press them to reconsider their position about Tibetan religious and cultural freedom. She went on to say, I've had those conversations for more than a decade with Chinese leaders. What about the position implied here that both sides already know what the other's position is?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, she has said that she will continue to press the Chinese government on these issues. Are you saying that you doubt that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there other people on the island like Mr. Stanford, other out-of-towners who cut a big swath?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Mr. Stanford really brought the island to prominence in cricket, didn't he?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With all the global economic trouble, does Antigua now see stormy weather ahead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's been the reaction in Sweden to the news that Saab wants out by 2010?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We'd only see it in car museums and collector shows?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to ask you about two developments in the news today. We now know that Benjamin Netanyahu has been asked to serve as the leader of the state of Israel. We have also learned in the news today that Iran has acquired enough nuclear material to make a nuclear bomb. Netanyahu has signaled that his primary focus will be on Iran and the development of nuclear weapon. How does that change or complicate U.S. policy toward Iran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Even with the much more hard-line government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I love the way he announced his comeback. He did it on his Web site yesterday saying, simply: I am now ready to play again. This is kind of like Michael Jordan returning from his first retirement. Isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah Stefan, I seemed to recall a couple of weeks ago, you talked about the exit of soccer star, David Beckham from the U.S. It hasn't happened yet, so give us an update. What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hello?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, when the scare came along a couple of years ago about the lead-coated toys from overseas, you know, I have seven grandchildren, and I don't want my grandchildren playing with toys coated with lead paint. And so, I got thinking about it, and I said, well, gee, I've got this really nice woodworking shop, employing all these people, making all these other things. Why don't we try going into the toy business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This game here, which is Goofy Dress-Up, the kids see who can get dressed up in their parents' clothes first. And you turn it over, and you've got Spin Do, and this is an interactive game, like pretend you're riding a bike in different ways, pretend to be a chicken laying an egg at the farm. Fun things for kids to do, you know?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Commentator Clancy Sigal is a novelist and screenwriter. This is MORNING EDITION. Joining us now from Great Falls, Montana is NPR's Martin Kaste. And Martin, you're watching the U.S. Senate race between Democrat Jon Tester and Republican incumbent Conrad Burns. And, of course, control of the Senate hangs on this state and Virginia at the moment. You're at Tester's headquarters. How close is the race?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, just in a second or two, any notion of when they'll call this race?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's start with South Dakota, where there was a proposal that would ban virtually all abortions in the state. What happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So no court challenge, this law is gone?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, another contentious initiative was the one on stem cell research in Missouri, which is turning out to be extraordinarily close. Can you describe what is behind that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Very briefly, did these kinds of ballot measures actually bring more people to the polls?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any chance Florida could repeat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did Donovan persuade his players to stay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Florida's got a strong team. Who are the other serious contenders?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you expect that evangelical voters will turn out in huge numbers on Tuesday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is the message, to some degree, you may not like the Republicans, but there's really only one candidate running - you can't even consider voting for a Democrat in most cases?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What evidence do you see that Christian conservative voters are responding to that message from the top?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about how this might affect a specific race. There's a very close Senate race in Virginia between Jim Webb, the Democratic challenger, and Senator George Allen, who is a favorite of Christian conservatives. And you sent us this - it's a copy of a 2006 Christian Coalition voter guide - which tries to list their positions. What is of significance here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it fair to say that every single issue makes Allen look good, and every single issue makes Jim Webb look not so good?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's been speculation that scandals of the fall - the Foley scandal in Congress, for example, might - over congressional pages - might cause turnout for Republicans to be depressed. Do you think that's really going to happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does this make you wonder if there might be an occasion, like past elections, where at the very end, there's a real surprise at how well Republicans have done?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as you read the language, do you think that Facebook has fundamentally changed something about the agreement with users here or is this kind of legalese that we're getting bogged down in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I guess where this might get more pernicious would be, you know, if I post pictures or video on my own Facebook page, then delete my account, what happens to those if Facebook still owns them and has rights to them? What could they do with them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And they carry both the reactors and the nuclear weapons on board?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How fast were these two vessels traveling and how far below the surface?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, no one was hurt. No reported radioactive leaks. But this is a very close call that could have had a horrible outcome. Just how bad could this have been?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that it's possible this might lead to change in procedure?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And we're back with Omar Gallaga. He covers new technology for the Austin-American Statesman. Omar, Tamara raises an important question there. Does the benefit of not printing so many pictures outweigh the cost of plugging in a digital picture frame?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I imagine than people who've come to depend on all that gadgetry in their homes will find it difficult to give up some of these things. That's probably the easiest way to shrink your environmental footprint is actually to do without some of this, but are there things that you can do without getting up something to actually reduce your energy consumption?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, Omar, we can all do our part to send off energy-sucking gadgets in the so-called vampire power, which sounds so scary, but are companies coming up with energy-efficient gadgets that will use less energy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...and you were raised in California. Does the fact that you come from a mixed-race marriage affect your vision or your plans for the organization?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what you're talking about are a lot of the shovel-ready jobs we've been hearing so much about. But increasingly, we're becoming a white collar society. What stimulus jobs are there for people like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Clearly, some parts of the country will do better than others, yes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Leisure and hospitality, huh? It sounds like a great thing after all the stress of job loss. And where do you see leisure and hospitality growing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if I'm looking for a job now, how should I approach my job search differently than I might have only a few years ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One final question. What do you think the job market is like for people writing books about finding jobs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does it feel that your cupcake portraits are under the same roof with paintings of George Washington and Lincoln and others?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Will you eat a cupcake yourself?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what's the problem with tissue engineering that you're to solve here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is it about cotton candy that makes it work for these purposes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, where did this come from? Were you eating some cotton candy at the beach?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Explain how it works exactly, would you please?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, is this just regular circus ridey(ph) cotton candy, the stuff anyone can buy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Spector, I have a last question. Has this (unintelligible) the process of eating cotton candy for you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What could you see from where you got married?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, why did you two choose the Empire State Building and get involved in the contest? What does it mean to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Delon, how did you two actually got engaged?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I bet you've just inspired a lot of guys, Delon. So, you now have Valentine's Day and your anniversary on the same day. How are you going to handle that in the future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, is he likely to be punished because of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's a question as to whether it was against the rules of baseball to be using these drugs in 2003. Wasn't it evident to players that they weren't supposed to be using performance-enhancing drugs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, why does it take Alabama so many pages to do what every other state does with relative brevity?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, take us back to 1901. How did the constitution get adopted, and why are there grounds in that process for you to try to overturn the constitution?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think people in Alabama are still paying for the sins of 1901, in that case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But you have this state constitution, which is so encyclopedic that it does everything from banning duels to explaining how - one of my favorites -how Alabama would acquire foreign territory. I don't fully understand that. If you throw out the constitution, wouldn't there be a thousand holes in state law that the legislature would then have to pass by statute?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That was earlier this year. Do you still believe there's no anti-incumbent mood?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you anticipate, that after this election, there needs to be some significant change in the way that the United States approaches Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does Congress have a responsibility to push the commander in chief, at this time, to change direction somewhat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me try to put that in my own words so that I understand it. Are you saying you trust the president to do what he will in Iraq? You'll look afterward, but you're not pushing him to change direction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, let's start with William Mcguire of United Health, Dick Grasso of the New York Stock Exchange. The faces of CEO pay today, what do they say about the broader economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 370 times?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A mere 131. Wasn't it even way lower than that if you went back a few decades?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if you're making 370 times the average worker, how much money is that, in the case of someone like Grasso?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wow. So what's happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you have a few people in the stratosphere. The median worker, the person in the middle, is just treading water, doing okay, not getting any worse. Who's really losing here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are immigrants to blame here at all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And let's talk first about the Making Work Pay tax cut. It's a shrunken down version of what President Obama wanted. Who gets it and how much will they get?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And this is not what we saw a couple of years ago with a lump sum rebate check in the mail. It's a credit per paycheck, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you do think that $8 or $9 a week - that is stimulative to the economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another provision in here has to do with the Alternative Minimum Tax. And there's a $70 billion tax break for middle income Americans to try to avoid the AMT. Who's covered in that? How much might they save on their tax bill?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are a couple of tax credits also in here - one is for college tuition and expenses, how about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about car buyers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you put all these things together, does it strike you that this is a genuine boost to the economy - that stimulus really is embedded in these things?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Clint Stretch is managing principal of tax policy at Deloitte Tax in Washington. We have bird news now. News of just what kind of bird was sucked into the engines of U.S. Airways flight 1549 last month, leading to the jet's splash landing in the Hudson River. Samples of the bird remains were sent to the Feather Identification Lab at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. Carla Dove is the lab's program manager, and she joins us to tell us what they found. Carla, what kind of bird was it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of material did you get, remember, these engines were under water, what did they send you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you saw the feathers that they have sent in, could you tell pretty much visually, without having to do the DNA analysis that you eventually did, could you tell Canada geese right away?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And could you tell how many Canada geese got sucked into those engines?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, and briefly, Carla, with this information, now, that these were Canada geese, what happens now for the folks investigating and trying to think about what happens in the future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Carla Dove with the Feather Identification Lab at the Smithsonian Institution here in Washington. You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. A little more now on how the TARP funds have been spent so far - that's the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Elizabeth Warren has been keeping tabs on the money in a role as chair of the TARP's Congressional Oversight Panel. Elizabeth Warren is also a professor at the Harvard Law School. So, what has she found?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Congressman Gary Ackerman of New York in grilling these eight CEOs today asked all of them to provide a written report detailing how they've spent this first installment of the TARP funds. Are you confident that that's going to happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did the former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson know that these weren't par transactions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What actually needs to happen to create more transparency to make sure that tax dollars are spent wisely?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you hear that either from Timothy Geithner or from President Obama yesterday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Morgan Tsvangirai addressed his supporters in a rally after the ceremony. He admitted that this political marriage wasn't exactly perfect, but he said it is workable. And in what you could read as a swipe at Robert Mugabe's leadership, he said that he would work toward righting the wrongs of the past. How does he plan to do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've been talking about the political obstacles that this new partnership will face, but there are many other obstacles, as well. Zimbabwe is facing tremendous challenges: A devastating cholera epidemic, widespread hunger, 90 percent joblessness and unparalleled hyper-inflation of 231 million percent - just that number is incredible. Ofeibea, what do they try to tackle first?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to talk to you about one key component of these toxic assets, and those are what are known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs. Why don't you explain for us just what those are?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And who is assuming the risks then, if it wasn't Lone Star?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you assume that a private-sector company - maybe a hedge fund - has bought some of these toxic assets, how do they then turn around and sell them at a profit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Not a lot of detail from Secretary Geithner today about how this partnership would work, but would you assume that he's looking at that example of Lone Star and Merrill, and using that as a model for what he wants to happen here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And professor, what would you say you would attribute the shift in tone to - that we heard from President Ahmadinejad today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you buy the notion that this is more than just rhetoric - that the president, President Ahmadinejad actually expects to do anything differently than he has up until now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Professor Dabashi, when you think about these elections coming up in June, do you foresee that there will be a fairly substantial sea change in Iranian politics? Or do you think it will be end up being more of the same, regardless of who's in charge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much of you had to downsize yourself?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. So how many people have you had to lay off?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, he was talking about people who can't get financing, and new mechanisms that he's going to try to set up for that. What did you think of what he had to say today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Reid, as you drive around - or walk around - Elkhart, what do you see that gives you a sense that this part of the country is in terrible shape right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Omar, you've been sneaking a peak or maybe eavesdropping on some of these sites, what have you been hearing and seeing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are some of the most interesting sites you found?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was the manager actually named in that letter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, it seems like this raises all sorts of questions for managers if they're coming across this kind of venting and frustration. And in some cases, you know, aspersions being cast on other employees. What do they do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Bush administration took a lot of heat for handing hundreds of billions of dollars of TARP money over to banks and other companies. How will the Obama administration's approach be different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I guess it was considered to be too complicated, too expensive. So, how, now, will this new administration do the same thing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John, didn't the Bush administration not take that approach because they said there wasn't enough money in the TARP to do it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And why would they want to do that if they didn't buy the toxic assets from the banks in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, John, what about homeowners who are facing foreclosures, anything in tomorrow's announcement for them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Commander Lippold, what was your position going into that White House meeting on Friday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, tell me more about that meeting at the White House. What was the tone? What was the nature of the discussion? Who was talking, and who was listening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that mean you would not be satisfied by a prosecution that went through the federal court system?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Commander Lippold, if you went into that White House meeting on Friday saying you felt guarded going in, how did you feel as you were leaving the White House?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lisa, I know you probably get asked this a lot, but could I just take you back to that moment in 2002, when you got the ball at midcourt, and ask you what was going through your mind?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's your perspective, Lisa, on the health of the league - the Houston Comets folding after all those championships, the roster cuts? Are you worried about the WNBA's future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There was a lot of star power in the WNBA early on. There was you, Sheryl Swoopes, Rebecca Lobo. Both of them are out of the league, now you're going. Who do you think picks up the mantle?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You just had your daughter, Lauren, 19 months ago, and having a baby is a big impact on an athlete, something that the male athletes do not have to do. How did you go through it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we'll turn to a lighter topic: death. Simon Critchley has written a number of books about philosophy, but his latest book is \"The Book of Dead Philosophers.\" And in it, he sums up the positions many famous philosophers have had about death. And in some cases, he shares how these people met their fates, as it were. Simon Critchley joins us from our New York bureau. What is your fascination with death, and the death of these philosophers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you studied the philosophies of death through the ages and around the world. Did you find any common themes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And tell us a bit about the layoffs at IBM in the past few months. How many people have actually lost their jobs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And this leaked memo, Project Match, what's actually on offer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I gather that one of the unofficial unions at IBM, Alliance at IBM, is apparently furious about this. What do they say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any sense of gratitude at all that IBM's trying to do something for these people who are being laid off?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are we talking about? What is this group at Treasury thinking of doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Adam, lets go back to basics here. Why is the government so intent on protecting these banks from the consequences of their own, as it turns out, rather imprudent investment decisions over the past couple of years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'd like to have you respond to the comments of Defense Secretary Robert Gates a couple of weeks ago before Congress. He said that the goals were too broad. In his words, Afghanistan is going to be a long slog. And he said, if we set the goal of a central Asian Valhalla, we will lose. Do you think there's a reasonable thing to do here, which is to downsize expectations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The government of President Hamid Karzai is seen as so weak and so corrupt. Do you think that the ultimate goal of a democratic Afghanistan can be achieved with Hamid Karzai at the helm?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We should mention here, Ambassador Khalilzad, that you are Afghan. Your own name has been mentioned as a possible candidate to run against President Hamid Karzai. Will you be a contender?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that mean you're definitively ruling out any run for office in Afghanistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Obama ran as a reformer who would change the way Washington does business. Did Tom Daschle's nomination undermine that claim?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, could the Obama administration, or could any administration have a rule that would cover what people do, not just whether they're registered to do it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But are there a lot of people in Washington who would pass the litmus test of, say, not being a lobbyist, but who are, you know, big influential players, who are being compensated to a great extent because they are former powers on Capitol Hill or in the executive branch?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " At the Department of Defense, Secretary Robert Gates brought in William Lynn as his number two. And Mr. Lynn was lobbying for Raytheon, a big defense contractor. But he was given an exemption. As you view it, is there a proper place for exemptions when you have a policy that says no lobbyists at such levels?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've also heard about Nancy Killerfer, who had the tax problem with the D.C. government and with - who was the overseer of budget and spending reform in the Obama administration. Did her tax problem strike you as a disqualifying violation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You don't think the bar is either too high or too low at this point for service in Washington?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sheila Krumholz is executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. So what about that Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at President Bush back in December? He is Muntadar al-Zaidi and he's been in jail ever since. For an update we've called Kim Gamel with the Associated Press in Baghdad. And Kim, what's the latest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And has he had access to a lawyer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what would the potential sentence for that charge be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There had been reports sometime back that the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, said he'd gotten a letter from Muntadar al-Zaidi saying that he had been induced to throw his shoes at President Bush by a known militant. Is there any more information on that or on that letter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There have been reports also that Muntadar al-Zaidi actually was allowed to vote in provincial elections. Have you heard that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you know whether Muntadar al-Zaidi has any idea of the international phenomenon that he's become since this attack?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And let's go next to NPR's Jamie Tarabay in Baghdad. That's where U.S. military spokesmen describe security as disheartening. Jamie, what's going wrong?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if we review what's happened in the last few months, the Americans pulled back, somewhat, from Baghdad streets, and tried to allow the Iraqis to take more responsibility. The violence got worse. So in recent months the Americans came back again, and became much more active on the streets of Baghdad. Now the violence is worse. What do you do now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did the U.S. military protest that man being released?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jamie, we've been talking about the security situation in Baghdad. To the extent that you are able to learn, is the rest of the country any different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is Kim Jong Il as isolated as his country seems to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He follows the Academy Awards?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Been shopping on e-Bay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell me some of the legends that have grown up about Kim Jong Il?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Even though his father was the founder of North Korea?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It was often said of Saddam Hussein, that he was insanely brutal, but quite smart in his own way. And the evidence was that he had survived for so long as leader of Iraq. Is Kim Jong Il smart in that way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you mean by wily?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any chance that this whole nuclear confrontation with the rest of the world is all about North Korea's domestic political situation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Early this morning, the United States hit a milestone in its own population. It happens at 7:46 on the East Coast. Let's listen. Unidentified Man #1: (Tape Recorded Announcement) At the tone, Eastern Daylight Time, seven hours, forty-six minutes, exactly. And if you're not entirely sure what the population was at that precise moment, you are not alone. We recently asked people at the National Mall here in Washington, D.C., for their estimate of the U.S. population. Unidentified Woman #1 (Washington, D.C.): Twenty billion. I don't know. Unidentified Man #2 (Washington, D.C.): I'd guess probably, I don't know, 150 million? Unidentified Woman #2 (Washington, D.C.): I know there are five million people in the District of Columbia. I don't know how many in the United States. Unidentified Woman #3 (Washington, D.C.): Probably two million. Unidentified Woman #4 (Washington, D.C.): Three hundred thousand million? Well let's check those figures, if we can, with Carl Haub. He is a senior demographer at the Population Reference Bureau, and he's been helping us track the population of the United States, minute by minute, all morning. And he joined us on the line from Fredericksburg, Virginia, just seconds after 7:46 Eastern. Can you tell us the population milestone that we reached this morning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Three hundred million people. Now, how can you tell that happened exactly at 7:46 in the morning - Eastern time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Mr. Haub, can I mention that, well, another minute-fifteen has passed here, so I guess it's over 300 million now. Three hundred million and what - three? Four?"}

And it turns out that the good old days were really good for the very rich. Two hundred sixty three million was 23 percent increase over the average in 2005.

It's the collection of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University. Brandeis is running a deficit, and it's reported could reach $10 million. University President Jehuda Reinharz spoke of this as a difficult, but necessary step for the school whose endowment has lost a great deal of its value. This might also be in part a spin off of the Bernard Madoff scandal. Over the years, Brandeis's most generous donor has been Carl Shapiro and the Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family Foundation. And Mr. Shapiro, whose now in his 90s, made a fortune in the garment business. He sold his company, Kay Windsor dresses, to Vanity Fair and invested much of the proceeds with an associate of his son-in-law, Robert Jaffe. That associate was Bernard Madoff.

Muhammad Yunus is known as the developer and founder of what's called microcredit, the extension of small loans to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. He's been a major force in fighting poverty around the world. Now, yesterday the Nobel Committee announced the winner of the prize for literature, and for the first time it went to a writer from Turkey. He's Orhan Pamuk, who won for his novel that deal with Turkey's complex identity. Yet many Turks seem puzzled if not outright suspicious of this honor. To explain, we've called NPR's Ivan Watson, who's in Istanbul. And Ivan, what have Turks been saying about this honor?"}

To find out why, we met some of the members offline, in the flesh, at the University of Southern California. Ms. STEPHANIE PORTNER(ph) (Student): I'm Stephanie Portner. I'm from Costa Mesa. I think it's really weird - just because like sketchy people can get on it, now.

Mr. JOSH MOSER(ph) (Student, University of Southern California): My name is Josh Moser. I'm from Thousand Oaks, California, and I'm a broadcast journalism major. On the topic of Facebook, I really don't like it being open to the public. Facebook is supposed to be for the students. It's not supposed to be used by the faculty. It's a student-run thing. If this is open to the public, then I mean, the sole purpose of Facebook is just kind of out the window. Mark Zuckerberg, those are a couple of students at the University of Southern California. Why do you suppose that anticipated expansion has caused a little bit of a backlash from some of your users?"}

More than 800 Palestinians have died since the war began, according to medical authorities in Gaza. At least 13 Israelis have been killed, most of them soldiers. Both Israel and Hamas are ignoring a U.N. Security Council demand for a cease-fire. Diplomatic talks continue in Cairo on a separate cease-fire plan. NPR's Mike Shuster joins us now from Jerusalem. Mike, what can you tell us about these leaflets? What do they say exactly?"}

Open season ends on Wednesday, December the 31st, and this year it's especially important to pay attention to the options. Some of the big insurers have changed their plans quite a bit. Robert Hayes joins us from our New York bureau. He's head of the Medicare Rights Center, a non-profit organization that, among other things, help people figure out what to sign up for.

This happened in southern Afghanistan and it's described as the most significant NATO offensive since it took over command of that area from U.S. forces at the end of July. We're going to go now to New York Times correspondent Carlotta Gall, who is in Kabul, Afghanistan. And Carlotta, what is NATO trying to accomplish with this offensive?"}

Well, inevitably, Steve, the morning newspapers here have had reports about it, about the tragedy of 14 families losing their loved ones. But the broader reports about this have really been looking into something much more complex and much deeper, and that is whether the British troops in Afghanistan are actually stretched too thin: whether they're overstretched. The Guardian Newspaper, this morning, had an interview with the head of the British Army, the new head of the British Army, asking him, simply, are the British troops overstretched there. There are about 5,000 troops in the south of Afghanistan. And asked can you cope, he replied: just. Just. We can just about cope. So the implication being that there is more going on there that they need to deal with, and its not just providing security for reconstruction. As we've just heard, there are firefights with the Taliban almost every day. Now, we've heard plenty about British ambivalence to say the least about the war in Iraq, where British forces are also engaged. What's the British view of Afghanistan, the public's view?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think Jaffe is now legally culpable for something? Might he be charged with something for what he did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When did you get the word this morning that there were cars flooded?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many people were in fact trapped and what happened to them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did the people say when you found them in their cars?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And just before I let you go, all of the people who were rescued, are they all doing OK? Are they alright?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I just want to make sure I understand that. I text the word kettle and the Salvation Army automatically gets $5 from me?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you've ever been involved in any kind of charitable work, one of the things that they will tell you is make sure that the people that you're speaking with hear your passion, hear your heart and your voice. How do you do that on a computer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Omar, you've mentioned a lot of different examples, but is there one that stands out in particular. Is there sort of a example A of how technology has changed the way that we can participate in charitable giving?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Omar Gallaga. He covers technology culture for the Austin American-Statesman, and he speaks to us on our All Tech Considered segment. My next guest has been watching the financial headlines with a spooky sense of deja vu. What pricked his interest was the Bernard Madoff scandal. He's the investment adviser who just admitted to running a $50 billion Ponzi scheme. Well, financial blogger, Felix Salmon, just felt like he'd seen this story before. And he had. Where did you see it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you saw a play about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wow. Wow. I mean, it mean it must seem eerie now. When did you see it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there anything different, significantly, between the Voysey situation in the play and the Madoff?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK, so tell me this - as we watch the real life saga of Bernie Madoff unfolding - maybe coming to an end, going to court, how does the play end?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how did you come up with this idea?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what exactly do you put inside the football, for example?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How is the resolution right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, it occurs to me that when someone throws a football, it kind of goes in a spiral motion through the air. Does that mess with the GPS?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I understand there's also a pair of gloves. What do they do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could it revolutionize the instant replay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " On the phone?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hilda Solis, a Democratic congresswoman from Southern California will be nominated to serve as labor secretary. That's according to a Democratic source and to union officials. NPR's Frank Langfitt covers labor, and he's here to talk about the choice. Frank, what does Hilda Solis bring to this job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Frank, how do you think the fact that we're in a recession and that unemployment is rising is going to affect the issues that Solis will face as secretary?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Organized labor has been very critical of Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, the sitting secretary of labor in the Bush administration. How would Solis be different?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, I went back and looked through the three inaugural poems that exist. Robert Frost from '61, Maya Angelou from 1993, and Miller Williams in 1997, and they're all very, sort of, prophetic. It's sort of what kind of country are we in? What are we going to be? on sort of a grand scale. Do you feel like that is sort of the model for what you should do here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why is this happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm just curious. Why are they looking to supertankers to store this oil? Why not store it onshore, on ground?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The price of oil slid to its lowest point in more than four years today. It's an eight percent drop down to 39.99 a barrel. When do you think we'll see higher oil prices?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You see them everywhere this time of year, those Salvation Army volunteers ringing bells and collecting spare change. Well, this year, for the third year in a row, someone has left something special in that red kettle in Lee County, Florida. Megan Spears is with the Lee County Salvation Army in Fort Myers. And Ms. Spears, tell us, what is that something special?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Most people caught up in the Madoff scandal are mum about their losses, but there are some signs of financial stress, especially in Palm Beach, Florida, where many of the investors are based. Case in point, the Royal Pawn & Jewelry store in West Palm Beach. Levi Touger is the owner. And in a Wall Street Journal story today, he noted that he's fielded calls over the weekend from people offering to pawn a Ferrari, a Tiffany ring, and a yacht. Levi Touger joins me now by phone. And Mr. Touger, judging from these offers, this must not be a run-of-the-mill pawn shop. A yacht?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you had a chance to look at the yacht yet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is it worth your while to do this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh, we wouldn't ask you. Yes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we keep hearing a sort of jingle in the background. Is that the door bell or the sign that - the noise that goes off every time someone walks in and out of the store?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there anything else that people are offering that lead you to believe that these may be calls from people that are caught up in the scandal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If I may ask, what kinds of things are people seeking to exchange?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I imagine that someone in your line of work is a pretty good judge of character. Is there something that you see about the human condition when people call or come in, in these circumstances?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we in no way mean to make light of the situation, but pawnshops are not necessarily associated with the very rich. Is this a case where we could put that age-old question to the test? When things go bad, are the rich really different?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, one of the questions I've always had is do rechargeable batteries work as efficiently as just plain old batteries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Digital picture frames are a wonderful way to preserve family memories when you've already got those memories on your computer. But we've got a lot of listeners who are writing in and asking for help saving their old VHS home movies, transferring those so that they're also stored in their computer. Any help for those folks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Omar, thanks so much for these shopping tips. Dare I ask if you have finished your holiday shopping?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as Anthony just pointed out, it's often the case that anti-corruption campaigns in China are politically motivated. Is there a political dimension to this particular case in Shanghai?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now just very briefly, earlier this week the government stepped up its fight against corruption. It asked officials to report details about their personal lives. What does this mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how did Mr. Salopek get arrested?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Saying that he didn't have the proper papers? Is that part of the charge against him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He was on assignment, we're told, for National Geographic Magazine. Had he even had a chance to write anything yet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said what he has told you. Have you had a chance to speak with him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is the courthouse in the state capital, of the state where you are?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. And the conditions, how are they for him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, I hesitate to use the word normal in a situation where things are so seemingly out of control, but is it normal for a journalist to be detained like this in that part of Sudan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who are the other two and what's their situation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lots of pomp, but I gather there was a mitigating circumstance?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lulu, how significant a trip is this for President Bush?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jim, you have been bringing Ebenezer Scrooge to the stage for the better part of two decades. I happened to catch your performance with my family last year at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, a glorious old theater. And we wanted you to come on to the show because we had a question for you. Why do you love doing this part? Don't you ever get Christmas Caroled out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how's your production and your playing of the character changed over the years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any little cues or improvisations?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is everyone phoning everyone else? Are you phoning other friends?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you give us a little description of Smithfield? We know it's the biggest hog processing plant in the world. What goes on there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how many people work there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, it's like a small city?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Kristin Collins, what is it about this decision to unionize that makes it so important symbolically?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, this has been a saga that's lasted, you know, the better part of 20 years. The first attempt to join the United Food and Commercial Workers Union started 16 years ago, when the plant first opened, and I guess the obvious question is, what took so long?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have immigration patterns changed in North Carolina around Tar Heel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you've been talking to workers since the results. What are they saying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what happens now for these workers and for management at Tar Heel's Smithfield Plant?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's historian Karl Jacoby. He's out with a new book called \"Shadows at Dawn.\" It tells the story of one of the darkest events in borderland history - the Camp Grant Massacre. On April 30th, 1871, more than 130 Apache were killed. They were living in a lonely canyon north of Tucson, Arizona. Many of the victims were women and children. And the perpetrators?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what was the immediate reaction to the massacre? Were the leaders really secretive about what they had done, or did they boast about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There was a trial, and they did, after all, attack a group of Apaches on land that belonged to Camp Grant, named for President Ulysses Grant. So what was the federal reaction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As a historian, what do you think we've learned from this incident that might be applied to contemporary ethnic violence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So there are some practical concerns as you get ready to head to Washington. Just curious, what's the temperature there today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it's not likely to be that warm when you head to Washington, D.C. in January, so what are you doing to prepare for the cold weather?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what's on your playlist?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And any special song that you might be playing for the president-elect?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How big is the health care sector as a share of our entire economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, just to give us some sense of comparison here. How does that compare to other industries or sectors of the economy that we talk about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was the Environmental Protection Agency trying to do, and why was the rule dropped?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I see. That would get you out of the charge of polluting the air over the national park?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were just talking about political climate when you said that. What other rules have been scuttled?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what was the role of congressional opposition to these rule changes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So those are some rules changes that the Bush administration has backed off. But some of the Bush changes are going forward, and one of them regards endangered species, one involving polar bears. What's the news there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Elizabeth, these are rules changes. Are these rules for keeps? Do they stay in the books for good now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " By the way, are you still interested in the Senate seat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Barring that, as you understand the Illinois constitution and the laws there, is there any way that the governor could be prevented from naming a U.S. senator?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is something appalling about transcripts of a recorded conversation in which a sitting governor speaks of a seat in the Senate as a bleeping valuable thing which he ought to get some money for. There ought to be some contributions in exchange for it. On the other hand, it's certainly not unheard of in this country for somebody who wants a judicial nomination to be expected - not just in Illinois - to make contributions to the party that might control who gets nominated for such things. Is that criminal, plainly, to be expected to make a contribution to the party if you're going to be considered for a patronage appointment by the party or a nomination by the party?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if it's just widely understood that that's what one does to be taken seriously in such matters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, help me understand how this all works. As I understand, you can buy and trade on specific days every semester?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So do you mind if I ask you about your hits and misses?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who hasn't?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand that you missed a pretty big opportunity with Apple?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do your returns compare with the S&P 500 or the Dow or NASDAQ?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if you're taking a more conservative approach or are somewhat risk averse at this point, what kind of stocks look attractive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If this all works out for your group, what happens to the profits?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Not even a lobster dinner for your crew?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you started investing with your own money yet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This seems like, although when you're dealing with Apple it may always seem like this, a David and Goliath story. How did Creative, a small tech company out of Singapore, rival industry-giant Apple?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Obviously the settlement means at least $100 million for Creative Technology. What does the settlement mean for Apple?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And for Creative Technology?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Declan McCullagh is a senior writer for CNETNews.com. He joined us from his home in San Francisco. $00.00 And let's go next to NPR's Eric Westervelt in Jerusalem. And Eric, we just heard about European doubts about peacekeepers - willing to send the navy but maybe not troops. How do Israelis see this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do they Israelis still expect that international peacekeepers, or the Lebanese army for that matter, are going to disarm Hezbollah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what does all this mean for Israel's government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said that Israelis are not optimistic that Hezbollah is going to be disarmed. Are Israelis optimistic that the cease-fire, at least, will hold?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is there a real threat then to the government of Prime Minister Olmert?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you see signs of people preparing themselves for another war against Hezbollah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, one other thing, Eric, just very briefly, is anyone saying, you know, this might be a moment when we have to radically change our policy in the Middle East and deal with Hezbollah, deal with the Palestinians in a different way, for example?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " General Casey said Baghdad is more secure. What's your impression?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In your own reporting, have you come across something the United States is doing in recent weeks that's different than in the past?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me try it a different way. Is there something they're trying that is working?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lebanon's prime minister may have warned against having a mini-state in the country's midst, but can the government, the real government, compete against this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Turning to the whole question of weapons, Hezbollah is balking at surrendering its weapons at this point in time. The prime minister has already said the Lebanese army's mission is not to disarm Hezbollah. When, and under what circumstances, would Hezbollah disarm?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is Hezbollah's military capacities weakened, damaged, more than it's willing to admit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How'd you get there, by the way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's talk about what that system is. Do you actually have an electronic map in front of you inside the car that tells you or helps you to know where to go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. Now, is that the only concern that you have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, you mention the GPS system taking a couple of minutes to load up. I've been in cars with these systems, and once they're up, they're up, and you've got a map of the city. Why does it take extra time for every single fare?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the basics first. When we talk about a peacekeeping force, what kind of troops will be there and from where?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Realistically, how long would it take to get 15,000 troops from several countries, plus 15,000 troops from Lebanon into the southern part of that country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, 15,000 outsiders plus 15,000 Lebanese, that is a lot of soldiers. Why would you have doubts about whether they can do what they're supposed to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can this work without the active participation of the United States military?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can I just ask, if there's so many obstacle to this force succeeding in the form that it appears to taking, why did U.S. and other diplomats - who surely know the same concerns that you are describing - why did they agree to this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me get right to at here, are you suggesting that British policies were the motivation for the people who were arrested last week on charges of plotting to blow up airliners?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if what you say is true, should Britain be intimidated into changing its foreign policy then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that there is significant support in the British Muslim community for using violence to express opposition to British policies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said that you have a responsibility. Of course, Tony Blair, at the same time you're criticizing him, he has pressed Muslim leaders to do more in this regard. Do Muslim leaders need to do more to educate the Muslim public in Britain about what is appropriate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Apparently, this first hacker cheated a little bit. I mean, what did she do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. And, of course, now I know that I'm in deep trouble with our IT folks for admitting that I hit the okay button rather casually, or rather desperately sometimes. You just can't bear to see it again, and you don't know what it's talking about. But, you know, I mean, does this demonstration mean that there are others lurking like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Will we ever get an operating system that's foolproof in this sense, that can't be hacked?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " David Pogue covers technology for The New York Times and MORNING EDITION. In Southeast Texas, Hurricane Ike survivors clearly are frustrated with FEMA. In Washington, there are questions about what FEMA will look like under a new administration. President-elect Barack Obama once talked about removing FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security and again making it a standalone agency. However, current Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff says that could hamper both agencies. Retired Army Lieutenant General Russel Honore disagrees. Honore led the military relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina, and he joins me now from Atlanta. And General Honore, you just heard that story about Hurricane Ike survivors and that massive pile of debris that they're still living with. How would FEMA acting as an independent agency do a better job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why should it be separated, though? What are the benefits of moving it from a place where it has all kinds of resources and quite a lot of staffing to an independent agency where it wouldn't be able to rely on all that? Lt. Gen. HONORE: Well, I mean, FEMA is inside the food chain of DHS. So anything that goes on its plate gotta come from its daddy at DHS. Or go describe that and go ask the people down there in South Louisiana, ask the people at FEMA who are actually doing the work and who are held accountable and have to look the people in the eye every day if it should stay like it is. Whether it moves out of DHS or not, something has to happen to make them more responsible to the poor people in the country whose only way of recovery is with the help of FEMA and with the help of the insurance companies. I mean, no disrespect to the people - the hardworking people who presently are part of the FEMA administration. Right now for many people in America, the word, the name FEMA, the acronym, does not stand for competence and does not present the safety net that people need on the other end of a natural disaster. In reorganizing or reconstituting this agency, do they need to come up with a different name? Lt. Gen. HONORE: I think, you know, we have become very astute to branding. And I say Amen to your previous comment, I have upmost respect... That was a question, not a comment. Lt. Gen. HONORE: Yeah. I wonder if that needs to happen. Lt. Gen. HONORE: Yeah. It may need to be looked at, rebranding. We've got to try to get people whole again, and we need somebody to focus on that. And it can be a laser beam, prior to the event and afterwards, to try and get businesses up and running again and get people back in their homes. Retired Army Lieutenant General Russel Honore led the military relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina. And General Honore, thanks so much for talking to us. Lt. Gen. HONORE: Good day. Five of the most prominent detainees at Guantanamo Bay say they want to plead guilty to plotting the 9/11 terrorist attacks. One defendant told the judge, we would like to submit our confession. Carol Rosenberg is reporter for The Miami Herald who's in Guantanamo, and she joins us. Carol Rosenberg, who are the defendants and what are they charged with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, how did the five detainees make their wishes to enter guilty pleas known?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And did they give a reason for why they wanted to plead guilty?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But is there any system in which a defendant may not plead guilty? It seems like a no-brainer if you're going to admit to the offense. You can't oblige somebody to put up a defense case, can you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did the defendants act through their attorneys at all, or did they only speak directly to the court in making their wishes known?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what happens next in this case? If the defendants say it's a show trial, we don't want any further part of it, and the court says, hold on, I can't accept your guilty plea, what do they do next?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I've been hearing about video telephone calls of one kind or another as being in the future. Since I was a little kid, this is the closest we've ever been to it. But we're in a big economic downturn. Is this something that people are going to be able to afford to do and to become very common nowadays?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And first, let me ask you. We've heard about Las Vegas. Is the situation that Yuki reported on typical of what's gone on around the country, or is it in some respects unique?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, we heard reference to people out in Las Vegas, all of whom are upside-down on their mortgages, that is they now owe more than what the house is worth on the house than what the house is worth in today's market. What's the current estimate of how many such people in the country are in that situation, first?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Keeping those people in mind, have you been able to detect any consensus coming out of Washington as to what the solution is? Is it to get house values back up again? Is it to reduce the mortgage debt significantly? Is it to let the chips fall where they may in the market?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If the object, in part, is to keep housing prices from falling any further, is that a polite way of saying that it's in the government's interest to inflate the bubble once again, a little bit, get those values up perhaps higher than they might reasonably be otherwise right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it's a big surprise, huh?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There was another congressional race in the state yesterday. It's still too close to call, but the Republican has a lead of a few hundred votes there. Are the Democrats in trouble in Louisiana?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Speaking of Congress, John, the last couple of days, the heads of the Big Three automakers have been before Congress begging for $34 billion from the federal government. Are they going to get anything close to that?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, how did you get into the dollar store business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you do at Ford?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you make as much money now as you did at the Ford plant?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But this wasn't the only venture that you tried. You did some work with foreclosures?"}

He captained his high school team in New York City. Susan Rice, the choice for United Nations ambassador, she was a star point guard here in Washington. And then there's the president-elect himself, who earned the nickname Barry Obomber for his long-distance shooting at Punahou High School in Hawaii. Makes you wonder, what do a bunch of hoops players bring to a White House team? For the answer, I called up a serious player, Bill Russell, legendary center for the Boston Celtics. What does Russell think of Mr. Obama's early draft picks?"}

Indian officials say top leaders of the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba directed the operation from two cities in Pakistan. Praveen Swami is following the story for the daily newspaper the Hindu. He joins us from New Delhi. And Mr. Swami, why don't you first tell us about these two militants who've been named as masterminds - one in Karachi, one in Lahore? Are these well-known figures within the militant group?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Indian authorities have been interrogating the surviving attacker and a number of these details seem to be coming from him. What has he been saying apparently about how the attackers came to Mumbai to launch the attacks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of these two men believed to be the masterminds, you're saying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There have been a number of questions raised since these attacks of about how 10 people could possibly bring this level of terror over several days. Is the assumption that there may be others that are still at large, who were not caught during these attacks?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it's official. The U.S. is in a recession. Now that may not sound like news, but here's the reason why we now say it is an official fact. Yesterday, the organization that acts as official arbiter of the economy announced to great fanfare, but little surprise, that the economy is and has been in recession for nearly a year. That organization is called the NBER, or the National Bureau of Economic Research. The group based its official proclamation on economic growth, unemployment numbers, and other factors. Jeff Frankel is a Harvard professor, and he's a member of the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee. And he joins me now. And Mr. Frankel, it's interesting because your blog carries the following headline, \"NBER Eggheads Finally Proclaim Recession.\" Aren't you one of those eggheads?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So why does the NBER seem to take so long to crunch all those numbers before daring to officially utter the R-word?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the National Bureau of Economic Research take into account less tangible factors like confidence or economic worries, the psychology of the economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So now that you officially declare that the U.S. is in a recession, can you officially make a prediction about how long it might last?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's NPR correspondent Guy Raz. He's spending the year on sabbatical, studying ancient history at Harvard University. In Iraq today, more than 30 people were killed in bombings. While security has certainly improved since the height of the violence last year, today's events are yet another reminder that normal life has not returned to that city. Ivan Watson, our man in Baghdad, is certainly a witness to that fact. Yesterday while he was out reporting, his car was targeted with a so-called sticky bomb. And neither Ivan nor any of the NPR Iraqi staff were in the car at the time, and no one was injured, but these attacks seem to fit a trend. NPR's Ivan Watson joins us now from Baghdad. Ivan, a real increase in violence in the Iraqi capital or just a bad case of the law of averages?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The explosive that destroyed the armor-plated BMW that you were seconds away from getting into, I gather, was a sticky bomb. This is a new weapon of choice or a popular weapon this year in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said that the increase in violence in Baghdad has been linked to diplomatic developments, to the agreement on - the status of forces agreement between Iraq and the U.S. Worst most cynical case here would be the violence has been tamped down in the interim. Now it's going to go back to where it was a few years ago. Do you live in fear of that? Is it possible? Or is this increased violence compared to the past year, but not at a level that you saw the worst of it a couple of years ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where had the bomb been placed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ivan, this has never happened to NPR personnel before. What are the authorities saying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who are these people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. On the streets, that arrest has only stoked Indian anger against Pakistan. Pakistan responded yesterday by threatening to move troops from the Afghan border to the Indian border. What's going on here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I remember seeing a poll that people in the military, especially officers and high-ranking, really broke for McCain in this past election. Is there a sense in the wider military of apprehension, or is he starting to bring some of them around?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, given that somewhat-more-wary relationship with Democrats, what's the feeling about the nomination of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you may - in fact, you are the one person in our group of speakers who would commonly be identified as a black leader in the political sense and in the traditional sense. Do you think you are?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, part of your track record, and you know it better, I would say, than anyone else, is that you've been charged with being everything from an ambulance chaser in terms of cases like this, to Reverend Soundbite. Why do you think that you get that sort of reaction from some people, including people in the black community, when earlier civil rights activists never seemed to get tagged with those sorts of criticisms?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do - why do victims, as you call them, come to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, well, let's just get to it. Do you view people who would follow you, do you view part of leadership as carrying the load, if it will, for victims, or do you view it as a way of empowering people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The publisher of New York's black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, has written of you that while white media thought they were using Al Sharpton as a caricature, Al is using the media. Do you think you use the media?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Last question, Reverend Sharpton. What do you think will be the legacy of your leadership?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In response to the British terror alert, U.S. officials banned most liquids from all carry-on baggage. How will these new regulations affect travel in the U.S.? Make it that much worse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Although they also said it was temporary. Is there hope in that or - who knows?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, airlines were just starting to make a financial comeback from the really terrible time they had after 9-11. How does this compare?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Labor Day is less than a month away. How will holiday travel be affected?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is this going to be troublesome for all U.S. flights or just certain flights - shorter ones, or transcontinental ones?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Reports say an investigation into this plot has been going on for a month. Can you tell us anything more about how the plot was uncovered?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, as Rob just told us, the plot might have involved liquid chemical devices both the U.K. and the U.S. have - both of them have now banned liquids on airplanes, that includes hair gels, lotions, beverages. What can you tell us about the suspected devices?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the United States has raised its aviation threat level, as we said, to the highest for flights from Britain to the U.S. And sort of domino-like, airlines around the world are canceling flights to Britain, limiting carryon items. What are the wider security implications of this plot?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, I just want to start with a definition here. Do you consider yourself a black leader?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do African-Americans need at this point in time political leaders? Or could business leaders, like yourself, do the job in the sense of leading the community towards equality and success?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Early in this series, we talked to NPR's Juan Williams who said that many African-Americans don't take enough responsibility for their problems. What do you say to that sort of proposition?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And for your parents, the new world was the new world, post civil rights?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I just have one last question. A moment ago you referred to looking at this photograph from the civil rights era in your childhood on a bad day. What would be a bad day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What exactly does that mean delaying the expansion? In terms of attacks in Lebanon, what will we be seeing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There have been disagreements in these past weeks within your government about whether a buffer zone should extend to the Litani River in Lebanon. That's about 18 miles north of the border. How useful would a buffer zone be if Hezbollah has proven that it can strike Israel from a longer range?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There has been grumbling - and a little bit of it has come out in public - at the length of this war with Hezbollah, that it's taking weeks, and that the amount of time it took to send in ground forces. How is Israel, at this point in time, measuring the success of its own military strikes? I mean is it targeting Hezbollah's leadership?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Big political news here. Is there any way to make the case that what happened in Connecticut politics is limited to this one liberal, northeastern Democratic state?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about Hillary Clinton - of course, another leading Democrat in the Senate - who voted for the resolution, giving President Bush the power to go to war, as did most senators? She hasn't seemed especially threatened in her reelection bid. Does this change that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And looking for a moment ahead to the 2008 presidential nomination, how's the Iraq war resolution and those who voted for it likely to impact that race on the Democratic side?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Juan, let's hear now - quickly, to two other incumbents who lost races yesterday. Michigan Republican Representative Joe Schwartz lost his party's nomination. And in Georgia, Congressman Cynthia McKinney lost the Democratic runoff election. What happened there, in brief?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It might make you a dumber person on the vacation, but over time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it's not exactly always about your mind, but some level of gratification that one would get by doing something different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what is your ideal vacation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, when you say you aspire to be bored - why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how does MovieBeam work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Over the signal from your local public television station?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm curious - the eight movies that disappear, do I get to choose which ones I keep for awhile?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Aren't people starting to duck all the boxes and rentals and just get movies over the Internet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How about MovieBeam, this new thing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How was that Jennifer Anniston movie, anyway? Did you enjoy that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, that's part of the top 100?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell us, what is the feeling in the Jewish community there today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You live in Israel, is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can you tell us about them, the - Rabbi Holtzberg and his wife?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand they had a little boy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And now, some fowl news. We've been turkey all week, so let's spend a few minutes talking chickens, specifically the business of chickens. This has been a growth industry for decades, but economists are predicting that next year, we'll see the first decline in chicken production since the early 1970s. Professor John Anderson is on the line now to explain what's happening in the chicken market. He's an agriculture economist at Mississippi State University. And sir, you grew up on a chicken farm?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what can you tell us, then, looking into the future about those projections for 2009?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But oil prices are down almost two-thirds since this summer, and grain prices have plummeted, too. Shouldn't that be good news for the chicken business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, if the industry is struggling, what does that mean for the consumer going to the grocery store? Does that mean that the prices will get higher or lower in the meat case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Professor Anderson, how does the broiler industry cut back production?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Uh huh. So first off, just to understand what's going on in my brain when I see two different colors, say green and blue?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's here? What are we seeing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which are the fields?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does it say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have a favorite among these?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you like the Americans?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Scherr was traveling with his daughter, Naomi. Was that usual, that he would take his children over with him on these spiritual journeys?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Had Mr. Scherr been in touch with anyone at the Synchronicity Foundation during his travels on this trip?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If I may ask, what kind of stories did he share?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have you been doing there at the Synchronicity Foundation to try to support from afar your members who are in India?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And we were talking about father and daughter, Alan and Naomi Scherr. Both were killed in the attacks in Mumbai. In a few minutes, a conversation with my mother about her childhood. That's part of the National Day of Listening. That's coming up from All Things Considered from NPR News. Now to Thailand. In the capital of Bangkok, it's no flights in and no flights out. Anti-government protestors are continuing their occupation of the city's airports. The protestors are demanding that the democratically elected government resign. They say it is corrupt. Today the prime minister went on television to declare a state of emergency at the two airports. NPR's Michael Sullivan joins us now from Bangkok. Michael, what does a state of emergency in this case mean for these protestors?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From what I understand, the main airport there is quite beautiful. It was meant to be sort of a symbol of pride to greet visiting tourists when they arrived. What was the scene like there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Michael, I just want to go back to these protestors' demands. They want the prime minister out. They say that he's a proxy for the former prime minister who was forced out in a coup two years ago. What is the possibility that we might be looking at the beginning of yet another coup in this country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you stayed under your tables for how long?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you actually see the attackers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Were they shooting at specific people, or were they just randomly firing at people inside the hotel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how did you eventually get out of the hotel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you left the building, what happened at that point? Did they take you for any kind of debriefing or did you just head right home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, as you're back in your house surrounded by things that are familiar to you. Are you starting to process this? I'm just wondering, what does this mean for Mumbai and your country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First of all, how much are home prices down from this time last year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which cities have been hit the hardest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have the prices for more expensive homes fallen more dramatically than moderately priced homes or what you might call starter homes? Or are these numbers fairly consist across category?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When people look at these numbers, they're looking to folks like you to help them understand what this means and the question of whether there's some sort of elasticity in the market. If the housing prices in some of these areas were overextended and now there's a question of whether they are, sort of, below market value, where might things start to settle?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Blitzer, we're probably going to have to leave it at there - at that. Thanks so much, sir. David Blitzer is the chairman of the Index Committee at Standard & Poor's. Thanks very much. Joining us now is Ashley Tellis. He is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is an expert in international security and South Asia. He joins us from his home in Virginia. Mr. Tellis, we've just heard Shishir Joshi describe the situation there in Mumbai, and there are questions now about claims of responsibility. What do you know about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If it's a nom de plume, who might they be representing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With the use of guns, grenades, coordinated attacks at several points throughout the city, do you see a detectable pattern there that you might have seen in previous terrorist attacks throughout India?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " India's army is now making moves against the suspected attackers. How effective have India's security services been in trying to combat terrorism?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why has James Jones emerged as the top pick, and what does this say about Barack Obama's foreign policy agenda?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, he will be sitting in a hot seat there in the NSA office in the White House. And you talk about judgments that he made. Is there a particular judgment, a particular case or scenario, that you want to share that says something about his leadership style and his judgment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned that he's a big man. He's six foot four. He's 64 years old. He spent part of his childhood in Paris. Is there anything else that you know about him that you can share with us, in particular how he spent his time after he retired from the Marine Corps?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That said, are there things Israel and Hezbollah would each need to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is called an international peacekeeping force. So who might be in it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The U.S. has not expressed interest in being part of this force. Other countries have been reluctant. Any guesses as to what the ultimate makeup may actually be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how did the estate tax and the minimum wage increase get married in this same bill?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's break it down. What's the economic argument for raising the minimum wage?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the argument against it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. Let's switch to the estate tax. A stand-alone version of the estate tax bill failed in the Senate just two weeks ago. Does it look like the votes are there to get it done this time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Israel began a 48-hour suspension of its air campaign in southern Lebanon this morning. What happens when that suspension ends Wednesday morning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Although then, that sounds like no suspension at all, because has the air campaign so far not been about getting to Hezbollah? Surely you're not intentionally targeting civilians, so what's the difference?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But, let us, to the issue at hand, is there a 48-hour suspension of the air campaign or is there not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So there will, there can be more civilian casualties in the next two days. But given that Hezbollah hides, if you would like to put it that way, behind civilians, and given that the vast majority of those killed in the conflict have been Lebanese civilians, how can Israel and how can the Israel military and those you command continue to pursue a military strategy were so many civilians deaths are inevitably part of it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Had you done that ever before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When was the first point on Saturday that you realized, boy, what we have is just way more people than I ever thought we would?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many pounds of produce - of potatoes and onions and carrots - do you think walked off the farm this weekend?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But the fields are clean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, Mr. Miller, what do you think? Would you do this again next year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, I bet. What was the best thing you heard all day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the numbers look downright scary at this point. Retail sales had their worst month on record in October, down 2.8 percent from the month before. What does that mean for the holiday season?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sure seems like the malls are full of sale signs, at least the ones I've been in. Are the sales different this year than in past years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are the online companies better situated to ride this out than the brick-and-mortar stores?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mechanics?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you get a sense that Mr. Bush will sign off on this glut of pardons in the same way that Bill Clinton did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What other sorts of political pardons could President Bush give?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Scooter Libby is Lewis Libby, who was the former chief of staff to Dick Cheney, who got a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence for his role in the Valerie Plame case. Can I ask you, what's the difference between commuting a sentence and pardoning someone?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So who has President Bush pardoned?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, no rest for Iowa, huh?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK, what's the temperature outside right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, one degree sounds like winter to me. Mr. Couser, are you surprised at all to see Huckabee and Jindal coming through the state this early?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have any advice or requests for the pols that are coming through looking towards 2012?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you get to meet Huckabee or Jindal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's OK. Mr. Middleton, how common is it for a company to pay the ransom on a hijacked ship?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much do the companies usually pay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is it paid, in fact, in dollars, as you say, in cash currency?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, this private security company takes the cash to the hijacked ship, the pirates divvy it up, and then how do they get away?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, I have to ask, doesn't paying ransom and this much money in ransom just encourage more piracy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Sirius Star, the Saudi oil tanker, is still out there, in fact, and we're hearing reports now that a faction of Islamic militants in Somalia is angry that a vessel from an Islamic nation has been seized. Is there a threat of a backlash against the pirates within Somalia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have a favorite subject for these cartograms?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The 'instep.' The championship game will be on ABC and also the Spanish language network TeleFutura. You think it's going to get much of an audience?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about what actually happens on the field? Is major league soccer in the U.S. comparable to what's being played elsewhere in the world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Stephan, talk a little bit about sports and the recession. The economy is slumping all over the world. NASCAR has laid off staff, The New York Times has folded its quarterly sports magazine 'Play.' This is a response to the economy. All the important questions for sports fans, how is ESPN doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Will they get to telecast the Obama bowl tournament that is going to be in place by that time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just in case you thought the only terrifying economic word that starts with a D was depression, we now are going to consider deflation. When prices go up when too much money is chasing too few goods, that's inflation. So deflation sounds like it ought to be fun. Well, economists know better. And so does the stock market. It went down yesterday, in part because of news that prices had fallen. Professor Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard joins us right now. And Ken Rogoff, what is so bad about falling prices?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the worst case risk here if there is deflation? What can happen to the economy if it's a prolonged problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I gather that the price declines that we reported this week were pretty broad. But to what extend does this reflect this enormous swing we've seen in energy costs that relay to a barrel of oil, which went up hugely and then has come down very rapidly? Can that be powering all of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, last week, in St. Petersburg, Russia, when an open microphone captured President Bush speaking at the G8 Summit, he said - and I'll paraphrase here: there is a need to get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop, then it will be over. What kind of clout does Syria have over Hezbollah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how does that relationship between Syria and Iran affect the U.S.'s dealings with Syria?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, does that bode terribly badly then, though, for this election, or the aftermath of this election?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it the case that the future security of the Congo will affect the overall security of central Africa?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what is the latest on this massive restructuring plan? How do you know, really, if it's on the right track?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Clearly, GM is taking on this task of restructuring the corporation. But is part of the challenge for the company also that, still, so many of the conversations about GM deal not with product but with cost cutting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So European nations are reluctant to contribute troops to a peacekeeping force in Lebanon, and the United States says it won't either. What is the administration thinking in this area?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yesterday we heard President Bush say he wants to address the root cause of the violence in the Middle East in order to bring about a lasting peace. That's the language they've really been sticking to. What are the White House officials saying about that now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " On Sunday, Syria's Ambassador to the U.S. said his country is open to direct talks with the United States. Is the president open to talking with the Syrian President Assad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And finally, as hostilities continue along the Israeli-Lebanon border, there is another conflict going on between Israel and the Palestinians. Is the administration still monitoring and doing things to defuse that conflict?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " NPR senior Correspondent Juan Williams. This is NPR News. Our business news starts with profits for the airline industry. A surge in American travel this summer has helped a number of airlines. United Airlines' parent company UAL announced Monday that it expects to report its first profit in six years. United emerged from bankruptcy in February, after struggling for years with high costs, management missteps, and a major hit on travel after September 11th terrorist attacks. We're joined in the studio by David Field, America's editor of Airline Business Magazine. And, you know, David, I just mentioned United, but American, continental, U.S. Airways - they've all either reported or are just about to report a profitable quarter. What changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, with the big airlines, they've been trying to raise ticket prices for years and haven't had much luck. Why are Americans willing to pay more now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does this in any way sense mean the industry has turned the corner?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How are the Europeans, and particularly the French, reacting to this eighth straight win by an American?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Floyd Landis had dropped to eleventh place after this, the tortuous alpine stage in the race. He made a remarkable, and some are saying historical, comeback. How did he do it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Floyd Landis does have a degenerative hip condition, and he will be having hip replacement surgery this fall. Is that good or bad for his chances of competing in the Tour again?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how much of your workforce is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you also, I think, had to close a number of facilities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how much of this scaling back would you say is directly linked to the problems of the Big Three automakers in Detroit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are you hearing from your fellow suppliers when you talk informally? What else - what are they saying to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, Mr. Sherrill, there was a study by the consultant Grant Thornton that estimated that one-third of auto suppliers are in danger of collapse. That's a really shocking number. Does that sound right to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Gregg Sherrill is chairman and chief executive officer of the auto parts supplier Tenneco. In this season of the political cycle, it is the time for burrowing. It sounds like a very rodent thing to do, but it's actually something that political appointees in the federal government do. Some political appointees who were facing the loss of their sponsors - in this case, the Republican agency heads - get career jobs and become part of the permanent civil service. Juliet Eilperin, a national political correspondent for The Washington Post, has reported on some burrowing that's going on this year at the Department of the Interior. Juliet Eilperin, who's burrowing in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what level of civil servant are we talking about? How high or how low are they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which raises the question, do you get the impression people are doing this in order to have a longer influence on policy or to have a good job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How have Mr. Komer and Mr. McEwen distinguished themselves? What have they done to influence policy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These people will soon report to political appointees of the Obama administration. Would you expect them, based on past history of others, to salute smartly and run up the Hill, or wouldn't they be obstructionist from inside the career service?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A White House spokesperson said yesterday there have been about 20 such conversions to career status across all agencies in the Bush administration. And the comparable figure for the Clinton administration was 47. Does that strike you as about right, or is the evening still young for conversions in the Bush administration?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if I have this right, there have been 12,837 games in NFL history and never an 11-10 score. Why not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, it's the 11 part of the score that's the strange one here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's walk through how the Steelers ended up with 11 points. It's a little bit fluky, right? They recorded a safety. They tackled the chargers in their own end zone. That's two points, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, for folks in your line of work, following sports numbers throughout history, is a game like yesterday's Steelers starters game, is it a great day that something has happened that hasn't happened in almost 13,000 games?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This 11-10 score, unprecedented in NFL history. Have we seen that score in college football?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. OK. So, is there anything in the economic stimulus that might actually pass through Congress this week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, there is some politics going on, as there always is on Capitol Hill. Tell me about Ted Stevens. Senate Republicans are scheduled to meet Tuesday to decide whether the Alaska senator should be expelled from the caucus?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dingell or Waxman, who's your money on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One last question, Janet. There's sort of an air of insignificance around a lame-duck session. I mean, we were just talking about how very little policy's actually going to be done here, but lame-duck sessions are important to keep your eye on, are they not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happened? He didn't like it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Shattering news now from the desk of Is Nothing Sacred? The staff of President-elect Barack Obama announced yesterday that his weekly radio address, a modern tradition started by President Ronald Reagan, will be released on video and put on YouTube. The first one is already posted there. The radio address on video? For those of us in the radio business, this is just the last straw, and I have NPR's Susan Stamberg on the line. Susan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " No?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Bye. Now, to Inspector Paul Hartwell with the County of Los Angeles Fire Department. We have him on the line. Inspector Hartwell, where are you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you see the fire?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does it look like to you? How does it compare to others you've fought?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're one of a few people who can actually get close to this thing. What is it like? What does it sound like? What does it look like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now if - you are all calling in reinforcements?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Inspector Hartwell, how long have you been out there so far?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " It makes you wonder, though, which countries got left standing in line at the door? Well, of the world's top 20 economies, four were left out, Iran, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and Spain. Rubbing salt in those wounds are three smaller economies that did get in, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. Of course, Spain did get in through the back door, since the E.U. 's current president is French, and no one was going to let France get two seats - which raises the question, if Spain got to come to this meeting, will it be there next time?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has anyone observed any kind of consequences that this has already had, positive or negative?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If humans begin to ramp down carbon dioxide emissions or at least the increase of carbon dioxide emissions, could this be mitigated somewhat in the future? Or is the snowball already rolling, so to speak?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do the other Arab states that you mentioned have leverage? The Saudis, Egypt, Jordan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If the actors are stuck in their positions and there doesn't seem to be anyone with any leverage, what kind of diplomacy is possible here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think was Hezbollah's goal in provoking this current conflict?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Bring us up-to-date on the investigation, please?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And of course, Pakistan has supported separatist rebels in Kashmir. Is that why India's prime minister has called for this review of relations with Pakistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But is there any hard evidence that the Pakistanis were involved?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you make that decision, though? How do you draw the line?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has there ever been a time when you feel you made the wrong choice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With so many people homeless and with the most visible - single people, mostly men with substance abuse problems or mental health problems - a lot of people just feel like it's a horrible nuisance. What do you say to those people?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And were you caught in any of the bombardment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you seeing a lot of support for Hezbollah or frustration with Hezbollah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have fear for the democratic government of Lebanon that it may fail or become even more powerless?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lebanon went through more than a decade of civil war and was just recovering. Tourists were beginning to return to your beaches and to Beirut. Do you fear now that you're back where you started again?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You have said that there's no going back to the status quo. So what is Israel's end game in this current fight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We're obviously assuming that this entire fight is about more than the release of two soldiers held by Hezbollah. What would bring an end to the crisis?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you hope to disarm Hezbollah though by launching massive attacks on Lebanese infrastructure and civilians unrelated or at least not related directly to Hezbollah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Israel bombed a main road from Lebanon to Syria, in part arguing at the time that word had gotten back that the soldiers were perhaps on the way to Iran via Syria. Is Israel prepared to bomb Syria?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, isolating them by way of embargos is one thing, but is Israel prepared to bomb either Syria or Iran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what would be starting with Israel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are people were you are, wondering why Hezbollah did what it did in recent days, staging this raid into Northern Israel, which has led to this Israeli response?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Saudi Arabia has accused Hezbollah of what it described as uncalculated adventures. Is there danger here, to other Arab nations, as this conflict goes on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is the government where you are, in Egypt, as while as the government in Jordan, under a lot of pressure now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you suggesting that it's now possible for hardliners, militants in Hezbollah, to determine the direction of events in the Middle East - and they can drag unwilling Arab governments along behind them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Throughout our history, a politician's faith and how it influences his politics has been a thorny issue, mostly for the politician himself or herself. Why have you chosen this moment to wade into this issue?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So are you talking, for instance, about, say, reaching out to very conservative Republican center, like Sam Brownback from Kansas, who sort of, on the one hand, led the charge on stopping the killing in Darfur, on slavery in Sudan, on helping persecuted Christians in - escape North Korea, and yet on the other hand he's a very, very strong and fierce opponent of a woman's right to choose abortion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does a Democrat, and especially one like yourself around who there has been speculation about your own ambitions, presidential ambitions, how do you deal with the suspicion that comes a Democrat's way when he or she speaks openly about their faith?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But do you think that talking about your faith, or talking about one's faith for another, say, Democrat would have political value?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And support with Japanese people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Japan's pacifist constitution, as you said, it was created right after World War II, renounced the right to settle international disputes by force. What are you saying, that this would be seen as a defensive move?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does Tokyo have leverage over North Korea other than these threats?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When it comes to the region, how does Japan's current stance effect its Asian neighbors?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does Japan's strong reaction create diplomatic problems for the U.S.?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, as many people have pointed out, when you're talking about budget deficit projections - and saying that you've met expectations or didn't meet expectations or beat expectations - you can move a few relatively minor numbers around in the federal budget, and utterly change your deficit projection. Did that happen here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why are tax revenues unexpectedly high?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, does this mean that the deficit is no longer such a big problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How are Congress and the president doing right now, on containing spending?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " In Alaska they expect to be counting ballots into next week at least, to figure out who won the race for U.S. Senate. The incumbent, Republican Ted Stevens, had about a 3,000 vote edge after election night. But the Democrat, Mark Begich, has now taken a slight lead as tens of thousands of outstanding ballots have been counted since. And there are tens of thousands more ballots still to count. Kyle Hopkins is a reporter with The Anchorage Daily News. And Kyle, they're making their way through, what, about 90,000 outstanding ballots? What are these ballots?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, they're still coming in. They think, what, two weeks after Election Day, they think they could still be having ballots next week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, apart from these absentee ballots, I gather there were also thousands of ballots that were questioned at the polling places, and also the ballots of people who voted early. Strangely enough, it's the people who voted early that are getting counted late. Why is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what's the process as they do this? Are there representatives or lawyers from both candidates' teams watching all this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, right now, with lots of ballots still to count, this is an extremely close race. What would trigger a recount?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the election, the Democrats won at least six more seats in the Senate, and a few races are still unresolved. Of course, in January they'll have the White House too, the Senate, the House. What's behind the push for a stimulus bill in November rather than after January 20?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Before the election, Senate Republicans blocked any action on the stimulus bill that the House had passed. Has there been any change of heart on their part?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the immediate prospects for another pretty big-ticket item that a lot of Democrats favor, which is help for the auto industry?"}

The Show Me state is the only state that has not yet declared a winner. As counties recount the votes, John McCain's lead in Missouri has shrunk to just under 5,000 votes of the 2.9 million cast. That's a margin of 0.1 percent. Matt Sepic of member station KWMU joins us from St. Louis. And Matt, what's been going on during the recounting and revision of the tally in Missouri?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These were votes on electronic voting machines. And something went wrong. They weren't included in the final tally?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And where are they from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, are election officials giving any sense of when you will have a final result in Missouri?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we just heard in that report from Louisa Lim that the spending, this $586 billion, is domestically oriented. It will be spent on housing and transportation and infrastructure. So how does that end up influencing economies outside of China?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So in other words, these big projects will require more imports. China will boost the markets for those around the world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " China holds a huge amount of U.S. debt. It's something on the order of $540 billion, I believe. If they're spending this much money on domestic stimulus, does that mean, by extension, that there would be less money from China to buy up, say, U.S. Treasury notes?"}

The week it was issued, he wrote, the medical profession, which is based on a boundless respect for human life, had an obligation to lead society away from disrespect of so many lives. Dr. Ronald M. Davis died at home on Thursday. The stock market took another beating today. The Dow Industrials lost about 440 points, just under five percent of its value. Add that to yesterday's similar loss and you get the Dow's worst two-day performance since 1987. Recent gains have been wiped out, and the market is back near its low for the year. NPR's Jim Zarroli is watching the markets, as always. He joins me now. Jim, what was it today? Why are the prices falling right now?"}

And first of all, David, I understand that Obama has made his choice for White House Chief of Staff, and he's chosen Rahm Emanuel, the congressman from Chicago, to serve as his Chief of Staff. Is there anywhere any word on whether Congressman Emanuel has actually accepted that job?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " In that case, what is one thing that Barack Obama and congressional Democrats can do next year so quickly that, by the time your members are running again, they can point to that accomplishment and say, Obama and the Democrats delivered on that; for that, they deserve your vote?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just a couple of quick other questions. First, I was struck by how many candidates who were elected in hotly contested districts ran against the $700 billion bank bailout and how many voters told the exit pollers that they were against that. Senator Obama supported it, as did Senator McCain. You supported it. Is the season of bailouts over? That is, is it just too much to ask the Congress to pass another couple hundred billion dollars in special assistance to some industry?"}

NPR's Jamie Tarabay is in Baghdad and joins us now. Jamie, why was these two women included on this list? JAMIE TARABAY reporting: Well, according to national security advisor Mouaffak al-Rubaie, both Saddam's first wife Sajida and his eldest daughter, Raghad, are believed to be helping to fund the insurgent groups here in Iraq who are largely made up of former Baath members who used to dominate the country when Saddam was in charge. Raghad is also taking a leading role in organizing her father's legal defense. Saddam is on trial for crimes against humanity in one case and he's got another case coming up in August. It's not really clear where Sajida is at the moment. We know that when the war was getting underway in March 2003 that she was believed to have been on her way Syria. And now apparently she's in Qatar. But Raghad is in Jordan and has been in Jordan the whole time under the patronage or the protection Hashemite royal family. The Jordanian Prime Minister put out a statement yesterday saying that Raghad was here under humanitarian reasons and she hasn't been engaging in any kind of political activities. He also said that Jordan itself hasn't received any kind of instructions or requests from the Iraqi government to hand her over. Now, also on this list is the man who is named to take over from terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in a U.S. air strike last month. There is some news on Zarqawi's burial. What can you tell us about that?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And first, who's laying off workers nowadays?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now at one time layoffs meant business is slow. The factory can't afford to keep everyone on the payroll. So a certain number of workers are furloughed for a time, but they'll get their jobs back. Today?"}

To a great extent, the campaign has come down to them which raises the question, who are these people who after a year of primary debates, a winter and spring full of Tuesday night victory speeches, two conventions, dozens of Sunday newsmaker shows, perhaps a billion dollars worth of advertising, four general election debates, plus mailings, robocalls, door-to-door canvassing. Who are these undecided voters? So we've called poster Andrew Kohut who runs the Pew Research Center and asked him to tell us the answer. Andy, who are they?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, going back to that real clear politics average. Let's say they have about 6.4 percent still undecided, you would say on average 3.2 percent of them won't vote at all.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You did, for whom?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it's come down to Obama and McCain?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it conceivable to you that at this late date, you still could vote for either one?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is it that attracts - well first of all, John McCain, what is the positive part about possibly voting for McCain when you're on a McCain day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when it's an Obama day and you think you might then try vote for the Democratic candidate, what are the things you like enough about Barack Obama to make that seem plausible?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well speaking of financial decisions are you a homeowner? Do you have a mortgage that reset recently or a huge credit card debt? What are things like for you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really, really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well I'm curious you remain undecided. Or as we have concluded you have decided a multiple of times. Are your friends, neighbors, family, have they all typically gone one way or do you day-to-day meet people who were on the one hand supporting McCain and other supporting Obama?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Right down the middle?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well tell me, what was your reaction this week when your grandfather announced he was giving most of his fortune to charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you see it coming? I mean, did you know this is the kind of thing he had in mind?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was your upbringing, may I ask? Upper class? Middle class?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And your grandfather actually did pay for your college, is that right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But no further help once you were an adult?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I've read that you were a nanny at one point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was there a time, though, when you really could have used some more money, and there it was, sitting in the family account, but not at your disposal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was that frustrating?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And was asking grandpa an option, or was that made clear early on, that you weren't to do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell me what they were?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Nicole Buffett, she's the granddaughter of Warren Buffett, and an artist living in San Francisco. In case you're counting, it is day 18 of the World Cup. Germany, Argentina, Portugal, and England have advanced to the quarterfinals. One of the highlights from the weekend was a signature Bend it Like Beckham move in England's one-nil victory over Ecuador. Here to review the action and look ahead to today's matches is Seamus Malin, a soccer analyst. Good morning. Mr. SEAMU.S. MALIN (Soccer Analyst): Good morning. Well, let's start with that move by David Beckham. It's a free kick. The game was on the line. What did he do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I gather that, up until that moment, he'd been suffering in the heat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you're here in the United States, but you've been getting up early to watch all these games, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh my! Did you catch Argentina's victory over Mexico?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if Argentina won against a great performance, is that a good sign for Argentina?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now we've got more games today, and then the quarterfinals on Friday. What are the key match-ups that you're looking for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This could be your last Wimbledon then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you remember the night before, the morning of, the first match you ever played at Wimbledon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you walk out on that court beforehand just to get a feel for it? To look around?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was there a player who forced you to get better over time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you do? Did you train more, did you get stronger?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you feel that you transformed the game, because your physical fitness forced other players then, to become more fit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Looking back on your rivalry with Chris Evert. It's been often pointed out, that even though you were rivals, that you got along. And it's also been pointed out, that maybe tennis rivals, are not so friendly these days. Do you think the tone of the game has changed, and the way that players act has changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it help or hurt your game if you dislike the player on the other side of the net?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Barack Obama can give a very strong stump speech, but he's known for having a fairly mellow personality. Is he a natural salesman? Does he have the kind of showmanship?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But does he have the kind of showmanship you need for a 30-minute infomercial?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Were you planning to watch tonight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Will you be critiquing it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what are you going to be looking for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are people who oppose a GM bailout and who say, let Detroit fail. One of them is Peter Morici, an economist who teaches at the University of Maryland's School of Business. Professor Morici, why not come to the aid of a carmaker that employs tens of thousands of people, and some would say much more than that in related companies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Should it be a condition or a de facto condition of support for GM that Mr. Wagoner should go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That shaky video and the play by play reminiscent of \"The Blair Witch Project\" has led to theft charges for John Toplikar. The woman's voice you hear on the tape is Hayden campaign worker Teri Atwell, and she joins me now by phone. Ms. Atwell, in the video, you seem to be hiding in some bushes, trying to videotape Toplikar. What were you actually doing, and why did you do this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, when Calvin Hayden's signs started disappearing, I guess it could be anybody that was pulling these signs up out of the ground. Why did you think that John Toplikar was doing this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Kelly is Calvin Hayden's wife?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm just curious as to how this might change the dynamic of the campaign. Do you think you have a better shot at winning now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the theft charges that Toplikar faces, does that seem at all harsh to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how is the economy doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if people are worried that the economy is slowing down too much, why would the Fed even think about raising interest rates, which is something you do to slow down the economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's be brutally frank about this. Are you saying that Ben Bernanke, the new Fed Chairman, would have to consider his own credibility more important than the short-term health of the economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just to keep things in perspective here, what's the inflation rate right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a risk of looking in the rearview mirror here and attacking inflation that has already happened in the recent past and isn't happening now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the radars that you mentioned on the ships, and also the satellite detecting systems you mentioned, are they connected then to the missile defense system that is now deployed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if it works as planned, are they connected?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " so then, what are they connected to? What missile defenses are actually in place at this moment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when you say an interceptor, what's there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And this is a system that has been tested over and over again, through the years. What are the results, overall?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What we could say, I guess, in defense of these systems, is that under controlled conditions they have sometimes hit the target. Is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If North Korea were to test this missile, which theoretically could reach the United States - if they fired a missile out over the Pacific Ocean to some test target - could the United States test its own system by trying to shoot it down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this perceived missile threat from North Korea, Mr. Coyle, exactly the kind of threat for which the missile defense system was designed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There have been, as you know, Mr. Galloway, allegations in recent months of brutality by American troops against civilians. We should specify that the allegations have not been proven. But there were similar allegations in the Vietnam War, which you also covered. Is there something about a protracted insurgency that lends itself to that kind of brutality, especially as time goes on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How important is leadership on all levels in a protracted war like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm sorry, I missed that product. The wireless watch? I've got a wireless watch right now. It tells me the time. What is this other thing supposed to do?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. Renee Montagne is on vacation. Last night, U.S. forces rolled into the east side of the Iraqi city of Ramadi. It's the capital of Anbar Province and it's one of the most violent cities in Iraq. Insurgents have been more persistent in Ramadi than almost anywhere else in the country. Over the weekend, the American troops quickly tried to make their presence felt. That sound captured by NPR's Philip Reeves, who was embedded with the U.S. military during the operation over the weekend. He spent last night in the city. Philip, welcome to the program. PHILIP REEVES reporting: Thank you. What actually happened last night?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how did Iraqis respond as these planes flew overhead firing and as troops moved in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Philip, was there some suggestion that maybe the insurgents knew the Americans were coming and stepped out of the way, at least for a few hours?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does the size of this operation compare with the operation in Fallujah a year and a half ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, OK. Let me just be the advocate for the consumer here and say, why not just help everyone?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK. Let's talk about the plans that are out there, though. And starting with John McCain's plan. He has a plan that would buy up bad mortgages. What is that? What are the effects of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there other ideas floating around out there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, the desire to bailout Main Street, as we've been calling it, seems to be understandable. I mean, ultimately, though, in your view, is focusing on mortgages the way to go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does this work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So does that mean the roll of scotch tape over in the corner of my desk is actually shooting off x-rays at me?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you have to do this in a vacuum to shoot off x-rays, what were you doing using tape in a vacuum?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did you figure this out in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Neat. OK, so you did scotch tape. Have you tried anything else? What about the best kind of tape - duct tape?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But really? Duct tape? Does it give an effect to x-rays?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You haven't tried duct tape?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would the country be different? How would the country be different if led by a black man? I would think black people themselves and talking about the children in the schools, they would have a model to follow. You have no idea what an influence somebody like that has on children. And they see somebody up there front and center, hey, he's like me. I can do this. Can I ask your sister-in-law the same question? Leah Moreland? How do I see... How would the country be different if led by a black man?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And at this point, your compilation right now has Barack Obama up over John McCain by 5.5 percentage points. What does the overall trend line show in this race at the end of the campaign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you look at a candidate like Barack Obama, who's up, say, five, six percentage points now, is that determinative of a final outcome? Or have you - can you find plenty of cases in history where a candidate was up five or six points two weeks before Election Day, and lo and behold, they lost?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think polling methodology has gotten any better? Are polls more reliable now than they used to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mark, as somebody who's been enmeshed in these polls for a long time, how prepared would you be on November 5 to realize that the polls got it way wrong one way or the other?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " After living in Tulsa for awhile, your family moved to Houston, Texas, where you essentially spent your teenage years, in an area where your family was an immigrant family and there were also a huge number of Hispanic immigrants around you. Did the Hispanic immigrant experience seem different from your experience as an Asian immigrant?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the common threads?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did your parents improve their situation as time went on, after your moved to Houston?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As the years have gone on, is there something that you try to hold onto that identifies you as Korean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there something American that was new to you when you came that you have really come to embrace and is part of you now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what was it? What was it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what about the immigration debate would tend to push Americans apart?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what are some things that are being said that you wish had not been said, or, at least, not said in that way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why would you think that this immigration debate is any more divisive or dangerous than immigration debates that we've had in this country for centuries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you end up liking this young man, you created, with all of his disdain for America?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said that there's always been enough for America to offer to draw people away from their original ethnic identities and ethnic roots. Is that still true for young people today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when we see fears of inflation, is inflation really going up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what does the Fed use to determine whether inflation is really going up and how much?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's happening with that piece of inflation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what are they likely to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's remind ourselves of what the case is about, here. What exactly are Hamdan's lawyers arguing before the Supreme Court?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hamdan's lawyers, I assume, say that they have not been?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the Bush administration's response?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the Bush administration's response?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are you telling your kids, or planning to tell your kids, about their identity, and about some of the issues that you touch on in your comedy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So that gave this dilemma of, you know, we have all this porn, what do we do with it? How did you decide?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how did you burn it exactly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, Reverend Eldridge, if you think about book burning, it obviously has a dark history and you know, people burn a lot of things that they're opposed to. Did you think at all about whether sort of a public ceremonial burning like this, I don't mean to defend the porn industry in any way, but if you think about, you know, the possible meanings of that and how it might be taken?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What were children thinking, do you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've talked to General Powell. What do you think this means for him personally?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about money now. The Obama fundraising total for September was almost - am I allowed to use the word mind-blowing? For $150 million for September?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, $150 million. If you're John McCain, what sort of political advantage can you make of this, or can you? What can he do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What has happened here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Eventually all the characters in this novel meet in this house or their lives intersect in this house. Could you describe the house for us, please?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You used a lot of information from the private papers of former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft who worked, of course, for both Presidents Nixon and Ford back in the '70s. Before we get to some of the political dimensions of this, could you remind us how economically interdependent America and Iran were at the time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's get to the showdown, the OPEC summit in Doha in 1976. What do these previously classified papers tell us about this moment that we didn't know before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so, what happened then that would deal Iran out and make the Saudis the new staunch American ally?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, and pride: the seven deadly sins. They've been an inspiration for artists for centuries. Award winning poet Sharon Dolin adds an eighth sin in her new collection, \"Burn and Dodge.\" Sharon Dolin, what is it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Will you read your poem \"To Guilt\" for us, please?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you've written this book. There are no less than four poems about envy in here. And you have a lot of fun and play with the seven deadly sins. But the book is not named for that. It's called \"Burn and Dodge,\" this collection of poems. Would you please explain where the title comes from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've got a very quirky and wild style. I like it. It's very uninhibited. But when you talk about these themes, when you think about sins, do you think that any of the sins - I mean, if you had to pick one, which one would you say you enjoy the most, or relish the most perhaps is the word?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have the children's reactions been through all of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you tell those children, the ones who are upset, begging their parents not to go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are the kids being brought in with anything to keep them going? Do they have clothes? Do they have anything with them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. Are you starting to see a pattern in terms of the background of the families, what's going on at home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, this is a novel's worth of e-mails. I'm just wondering, does anything really get done?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What might we take from Martin's e-mails and Blackberry messages, and, you know, the totality of his life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I know that scientists hope to eventually recruit women to be egg donors for their stem cell research. Are there ethical issues here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When it comes to the delicate issue of paying women to provide eggs for stem cell research, what did your committee conclude should be the guideline?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...does that mean there's less federal regulation then there would be if the government was giving money to researchers and also attaching some strings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...has that case made you rethink any of the guidelines in place as other people compete to do the same thing for real?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that bogus researchers in the United States would be caught?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Granting that, you're the one who'll decide whether to go forward with trials. Are there enough public defenders to represent defendants adequately when your trials go forward?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Department of Justice, as you probably know, put out a report last month saying that what was necessary was at least 70 public defenders in New Orleans. When I see it, there are thousands and thousands of defendants. It's hard for me as a layman to believe that even 70 is enough. Do you have anywhere close to 70?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Judge, what's the first case up on your docket?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, could you set the scene for us, Ms. Solomon. What were these executives told to actually get them down to Washington?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of case did he make?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how did Paulson make the case to a bank like Wells Fargo?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And first of all, would you consider nationalization to be the right word to be describing what we're seeing here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it a question of scale? I mean, is your hesitation in calling it nationalization because it's partial? Is it sort of like being, you know, a little bit nationalized at this point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did - what the Treasury Department did today, how does that differ from what the British have done with their banks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to briefly ask you to comment on a remark made by one of our political commentators last week, David Brooks in the New York Times, who concluded that the era of conservative free market economics is largely over. Do you agree?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Kenneth Rogoff is a professor of economics at Harvard University. He's also former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and he's provided occasional advice to the campaign of John McCain. The government's injection of billions of dollars into American banks is supposed to help them start lending again, as we've heard, to unfreeze the credit markets. That's also what's behind the plan to ensure loans between banks. So the big question is does it seem to be working? NPR economics correspondent Adam Davidson has been following the credit markets. And Adam, are you seeing signs of a thaw?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And we keep coming back to this plumbing metaphor. We heard the analogy made in John Ydstie's piece about turning on the spigot. It sounds like what you're saying is if the spigot is turned on, the water isn't flowing through the pipes quite yet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When banks get this injection, it's not clear to me what is supposed to happen then. Has the government outlined, stipulated things that those banks are now required to do with that money, beyond just being infused with capital?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in turn, would there be something else that the banks would want from the government before they would increase lending?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you can find more analysis of the bailout bill at NPR's \"Planet Money\" blog and podcast. That's at npr.org/money. This is All Things Considered from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. If you're looking for the country hardest hit by the global economic crisis, Iceland would have to be at the top of the list. Tiny Iceland, just over 300,000 people, but it's teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. In the last three weeks, Iceland has nationalized three top banks. Its currency is in freefall. So how did this booming country, hailed in recent years as the Nordic Tiger, become de-fanged? Chad Thomas of Bloomberg News is in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik. And Chad, you've been reporting about a run on the markets in Iceland, but in this case we're talking about a run on supermarkets. What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when you talk to people, what are they're saying? How afraid are they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, looking forward, the Icelandic government has been turning to its Nordic neighbors for help. It seems to get no love there. Now it has representatives in Moscow trying to get a $5 billion bailout. How's that going over with Icelanders?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there people in Iceland now saying, you know, maybe it is time to join the European Union?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, this is a huge increase. What was the mood like on the floor today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we're noting that this follows the news that the Bush administration is planning to take this ownership stake in private banks and private financial institutions. Is that strictly what's driving these gains or are other factors at work as well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jason, normally when you see this kind of big point gains I imagined that there'd be a certain euphoria there on the floor but you say that everyone was relatively calm. Is that because people are worried about this big question as to whether or not we've actually hit the bottom?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is All Things Considered from NPR News. I'm Michele Norris. Senator John McCain campaigned in Virginia and North Carolina today, two states that haven't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in decades but where polls show Barack Obama is even with John McCain or slightly ahead. McCain, who's trailing Obama both in national polls and other key battleground states, acknowledged his underdog status today. NPR's Scott Horsley is traveling with the McCain campaign and joins us now from Wilmington, North Carolina. Scott, John McCain is campaigning in once reliably red states. Is the campaign feeling a bit nervous?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we heard John McCain at a rally earlier today. We're hearing really sharp rhetoric there from the candidate in these campaign rallies. Do we expect to hear or see a much more aggressive tone in Wednesday's debate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Barack Obama was in Toledo, Ohio, today, giving what his campaign called a major speech on fixing the economy. Ohio and its 20 electoral votes are a big prize for either candidate. Polls suggests the race there, as in Virginia and North Carolina, will be a nail biter for both sides. We're joined now by NPR's Don Gonyea who's traveling with the Obama campaign. And Don, what were the headlines coming out of Obama's proposal today on the economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as we said, Barack Obama made this speech in Toledo, Ohio. That's a city that's been socked by the economic uncertainty and the situation on Wall Street. Was this intended to try to underscore his message about trying to reach out to the middle class?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In your blog today called The Conscience of a Liberal, you note that, a funny thing happened to me this morning, and I'm wondering how you did actually find out about this honor?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " No idea?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Curious about your view of the current crisis. Who should have seen this coming?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In your column, you applauded the Brits for moving with what you called stunning speed. You can't really use those words to describe the US bailout. Did we waste weeks debating Treasury Secretary Paulson's plan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are we on the right path now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the big issues this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what would you pick as some of the most important ones around the country then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's an interesting one. Could you explain that one?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. Now, when it comes to abortion and same sex marriage and these kinds of ballot measures that are politically divisive, they're sometimes used to drive people to the polls to increase voter turnout. Does that really work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In Massachusetts, there's an interesting one. The ballot measure would do away with the state income tax completely?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh my gosh, that seems like it would cut the state's budget or at least its revenues pretty significantly, huh?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we should say that these ballot measures are not always the big, hot issues of the day. There's a proposition on the ballot in California that's really specific about how some kinds of animals are kept on some kinds of farms?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is All Things Considered. I'm Andrea Seabrook. Today, the day after the worst week in Wall Street history, President Bush met at the White House with financial leaders from the world's biggest economies.

BUSH: The leaders gathered in Washington this weekend are all working toward the same goals. We will stand together in addressing this threat to our prosperity. We will do what it takes to resolve this crisis. And the world's economy will emerge stronger as a result. President Bush speaking of the world's financial leaders who are in Washington for the fall meetings of The World Bank and The International Monetary Fund. NPR's John Ydstie is here now. John, last night, these finance ministers and central bankers issued what they called an action plan. Did it meet expectations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK, five-point plan, but haven't these countries been trying to do all those things already? I mean, what about the specifics on how to do these things?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, does that mean the government is going to be taking control of banks, nationalizing banks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. The IMF and World Bank are primarily concerned with emerging markets, developing countries. Are they being affected by this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. John, so the bottom line, can this action plan, as it's called, stop the madness on Wall Street?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " North Korea is off the terrorism black list. This is the country President Bush once called part of the axis of evil. Now, North Korea has agreed to allow inspections of its nuclear plants. And today, in return, the Bush administration removed it from the list of states that sponsor terrorism. NPR's Mike Shuster has been covering these off again, on again negotiations, and he joins us now. Mike, what exactly did the U.S. agreed to today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what did North Korea agree to do in return for getting that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So did the United States get everything it was negotiating for? I know the Bush administration had been pushing for a comprehensive inspection and verification program. Did it get that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, is that a glimmer of what's to come, or is there a next step in this process?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did scientists have any idea that anything lived that deep, anything that was a vertebrate anyway, a fish?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did you get the camera down so deep?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, how you get any news at all out of Zimbabwe tells you something about the country, too, so we've kept Jason on the line to talk about that. Jason, I just want to ask about one thing. I noticed that some of the tape in that report was a little bit scratchy and over-modulated. I understand there's a story behind that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about Zimbabwean reporters? What kind of obstacles do they face?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you feel that you got an accurate picture of what was going on in Zimbabwe, despite the obstacles thrown in your way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, in just a few seconds, why is it that some people you spoke with think that there could be an uprising, given that there has not been a successful uprising for more than a quarter century now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why is the U.S. military asking these questions now, given that they dismissed the allegations when they first surfaced in March?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How's all of this affecting the political situation in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does he have any other options?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you or anyone from your paper been able to speak with him recently?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you talk about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned that, as we speak, we've just learned that the cultural center associated with him has been burned. Speaking more broadly, how has that political party been treated?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which gets to a bit of a mystery here. It's clear that if you're willing to challenge President Mubarak, you can end up in prison. But, at the same time, there does seem to be an increase in opposition in Egypt. Opposition leaders have more seats in the parliament. Your newspaper is running. How would you describe the movement toward democracy in your country right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " No commitment even though they've made these announcements, and made claims of progress?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is that a legitimate fear, that if you had a truly free election in Egypt that's who you might end up with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I have to ask, first off, if it really matters who holds this position in the Bush administration. We know what the chairman of the Federal Reserve does and how he affects the economy. How does this guy affect the economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the Treasury Secretary really have leverage to do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is the assumption on Wall Street that the White House needs to change course, and that Paulson might be the guy who could push them in a slightly different direction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I know that the story about the killings in Haditha has been big news in the Arab world, off and on, for some months. Correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've learned so many times that the headlines that seem to obsess the Arab media may be different from the headlines that seem to obsess the Western media. Is there a story, or a couple of stories, that are obsessing the Arab media right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As we've been told very often in recent days, the measure over the market that makes most policymakers most nervous is not the price of stocks but the availability of credit. Is money moving between banks and from banks to big lenders to keep America in business? Well, Will Aston-Reese is vice president for money-market sales at Tradition Asiel Securities in New York City. His job entails watching the flow of money between banks and from banks to their big customers. And Will Aston-Reese, have you had anything to watch today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who is losing out for that not happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how does this translate for people in your business? I mean, what is a day of work like today, say just in terms of your routine that's remarkably different from a normal day a few weeks ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Trading sites. People take longer lunch hours? I mean, is work life radically different for everyone?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think it would take? What kind of action would it take to get credit moving again, to start seeing some action out there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you seen anything at all today, any slight sign, any hint of something encouraging that maybe some money might be moving out there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Some of them discussing kind of big questions but at a household level, what's the best approach for explaining household finance, a shrunken budget to teenagers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much would the message change for say, middle school age kids?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Cary, I spoke with you just two days ago, and then we were saying the Dow fell below 10,000 for the first time in four years. Two days, and now we're below 9,000. What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what could possibly turn this around? I mean, how many more days dropping 500, 600 points are we likely to see here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Cary, are you among those who think we are either headed for a recession or in one right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And again, some of those - not all of them, but some of them - will have questions that are put to the candidates. You met with these folks from the audience today along with the moderator, Tom Brokaw. How did that meeting go? What were you doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about other balance in the audience? Are you trying to weight for men and women voters or for age or for race? Is it supposed to duplicate the community where you are today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you said uncommitted voters do not represent the total voting population. Who are these uncommitted voters nationwide? What does this population look like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What might surprise you tonight in this debate, Frank? Or have you been doing this so long that really you think you know just about any question that might be asked and how it might be answered?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson is also in Nashville attending the debate. And Mara, we just heard about the people asking the questions. How does that change the game plan for the candidates tonight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, there are famous moments from these debates. President Bush looking at his watch, as you've described it, and Bill Clinton saying, I feel your pain. But when it comes to voting, actually, have these debates ever really changed the outcome?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, put that in the context of the overall map, the Electoral College map. How does it look?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tonight is the big night in another race; American Idol crowns its winner. Now in its fifth season, it is the most watched television show in the country. Some 50 million votes were cast for performers in the contest last week. To put that in perspective, that's nearly as many votes as were cast for each of the candidates in the 2000 presidential election. One man fully caught up in the national addiction to American Idol is Jody Rosen, who writes music criticism for the on-line magazine, Slate. Now, it's way past my bedtime, this show, but I do know that R&B hopeful, Taylor Hicks, was in a face-off last night, against a classic girl pop singer, Katharine McPhee. These guys are all hopefuls, but you write in your Slate article, that American Idol is actually quite good for pop music generally. How so?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So where did your vote go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jody, thanks very much. Jody Rosen is music critic for Slate.com, joining us from his home in New York. This is MORNING EDITION. The business news starts with the extra money you're not making. The economy may be growing, but wages are not. At least they're not rising very quickly for working Americans. Even the typical worker with a four-year college degree has not seen raises much beyond inflation. David Wessel, Deputy Washington Bureau Chief of The Wall Street Journal, has been asking why. And David, what have you found?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that mean it's really not worth it to get a college degree in certain fields?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are college graduates getting into the same circumstance that autoworkers have been in for decades? There's increasing competition in the high-tech industries and the knowledge industries around the world, and that means that American workers are not necessarily going to get a big raise every year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I guess one of the privileges of your job is you get to go to the Preakness. What did you see of this injury? How did it happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let me ask about that, Mr. Haskin. I want to clarify that term, life threatening, because in the case of a horse, doesn't that mean that the owner might make the decision to put him to sleep?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And explain why that investment, and we have to call it an investment I suppose, as made in saving the horse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in just a couple of seconds, is there anything about the breeding of today's thoroughbreds that makes them more fragile?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I think this is why they teach it to children. But you love this, this sort of nerdy, folky instrument?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Shoes, ashtrays, baby pictures, a card addressed to the \"World's Best Grandma,\" All jumbled together in the musty old bedrooms. How do you separate yourself from this? How do you separate yourself from seeing the detritus of someone else's life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is All Things Considered. I'm Robert Siegel. The National Hockey League season begins tomorrow and it begins in Europe. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Ottawa Senators will play two games over the weekend in Stockholm, and the New York Rangers and Tampa Bay Lightning will face off in Prague. Sportswriter Stefan Fatsis joins us now to explain hockey's transatlantic efforts. And Stefan, should we expect big crowds of Swedish and Czech hockey fans?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, football, baseball and basketball have all tried to cultivate interest in Europe and also in some cases, in Asia. Is Bettman actually talking about placing franchises in Europe though?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've talked though in the past about how the National Hockey League over-expanded in the 1990s. Is it reasonable for them to be talking about adding more teams?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me ask you about a new tax break that's made some headlines. The children's wooden arrow tax break, 39 cent excise tax repealed, what's that about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, there are two tax breaks. They're estimated at $478 million for movie and television producers who choose to shoot films in the United States. Do we know who sponsored that one?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, Benton Ives, what's different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mean, the ceiling on an uninsured deposit would go up under this from a hundred thousand to a quarter million dollars?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then there's a tax dimension to this measure in the Senate, yes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. The theory here is that this should pass the Senate. That doesn't seem to be very much in doubt. The question is then, if it goes back to the House, would there be 12 more votes to approve it? I want you to put us in the shoes of a member of the House who either didn't vote for it on Monday or just barely was won over to voting for it. Is this that much more attractive than what they saw earlier in the week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you starting to see folks coming in looking for loans who have just much worse credit than they might have a while ago? You can't make them a loan because their credits so lousy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is there anything you can do for them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Moore, since we've been seeing the collapse of some of these big financial institutions, have you been seeing folks coming in to you worried about whether their money is safe in your small community bank there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think about the bailout package that's been kicking around in the Congress getting shot down and now seems to have another life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happened to your family, to your own village, since the Janjaweed have attacked?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. As simply as you can put it, what did you get out of the peace negotiations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " All right. You've signed on to a peace deal that gives sharing of political power, sharing of wealth, compensation for all the horrible damage that's been done, and some sort of plan for protection. Not all of everything you wanted, but enough to stay committed to this peace plan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your own group, the Sudanese Liberation Army, it is been publicly rebuked by the top U.N. representative in Sudan for attacking and harassing aid workers. And there have been reports of fighting between the SLA and other factions, where both sides were accused of acting rather badly, including rape being committed. What do you say to that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Given everything we've seen, given everything we know about the great exodus of people out of Darfur, and all the killing. Can Darfur be put back together again?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the bosses or the executives. Are they sophisticated, as regards something like sexual harassment, which is what's at issue here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you encountered, in your work, any cultural differences?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the biggest difference, if you will, or biggest pitfall, that face foreign companies working in the United States, given the legal environment, and even at this point in time, the social environment, as regards sexual harassment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Imminently doable because Iran is so much weaker in certain ways. But might Iran's very weakness make it more difficult to control?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Take a different scenario. What if Iran is able to use the fact that it possessed nuclear weapons to exert power over its neighbors?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are we having this conversation, if you will, too soon? That is to say, all the means to stop Iran from going nuclear haven't been exhausted yet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's for everyone in the world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about waiting times. When it comes to how long it takes to get in--if one has a connection with an employer--what's involved and why such a long wait?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is it then, when people talk about a line that hopeful immigrants would have to get in to enter the country if they want to do it legally?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And let's start first with President Bush. He has been out there urging both parties to approve this deal. He made a brief statement this morning, again warning of dire consequences if a bill isn't passed. Let's listen. President GEORGE W. BUSH: We're facing a choice between action and the real prospect of economic hardship for millions of Americans. Mara, is anybody in Washington taking cues from this lame duck president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the House leadership here, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Minority Leader John Boehner?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Mara we just heard from Scott Horsley and Don Gonyea about the presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama today. What do you make of the role that they played in these bailout talks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mara, what do you think it needs to happen now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said this is not politically easy for you, this vote today. That might be an understatement; you were quoted as saying in a private meeting with some of your colleagues, \"I'm willing to give up my seat over this.\" Was that an accurate quote?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Congressman Marshall, when you think about this yes vote that you cast today on the bailout plan, how do you weigh the importance of that vote versus all the others you've cast in your six years in Congress?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the final decline at the end of the day, it closed down more than 700 points, down more than 6 percent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the other markets, Jim? Bonds, commodities, what was happening there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And utterly dire predictions coming from the Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson; the Fed chair, Ben Bernanke. What is at stake for the economy if no bailout plan emerges and is approved?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what's the link between this news from England and what's going on in Washington?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, the bailout being worked out in Washington, can it put the brakes on the crisis globally?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, the first signal we're going to get on how this is playing out internationally, at least how international communities are seeing the bailout package working out in Washington, will be from the Asian stock markets. Are there any clues?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, why shouldn't a church or a pastor be able to say anything they want from the pulpit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You also addressed politics in your sermon this morning, would you say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Still, shouldn't it be the church's choice how they try and influence politics?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what do you think of these pastors who've band together to say that they should be able to endorse a candidate from the pulpit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what do you think the church's role in politics should be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Welcome back to NPR's All Things Considered. I'm Andrea Seabrook. It would be an understatement to call the scene on Capitol Hill this weekend hectic. The marathon meetings between high-powered negotiators, the sheer size of the economic bailout proposal, and the pressure to get it done, like yesterday; a better word to describe it might be traumatic. That's what Democrat Jim McDermott of Washington state is calling it. And he should know. Congressman McDermott is also a psychiatrist. How are you, Congressman?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds like the bailout negotiations are having a real psychological impact on you guys up there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, how does that affect you guys working up there? I mean, how do other members of Congress tell you the work is affecting them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Dr. McDermott, what do you advise your colleagues to do?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now this was supposed to be the end of the regular season, right? But it's going to stretch on for even a couple more days?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Those playoffs do start Wednesday. What's the big story there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " All right then. Now, Tom, we've got a segment coming up in just a second we do every week. It's called \"Homework.\" And our assignment for next week is to sing your favorite fight song. We're asking our listeners to do that. Can you give us your choice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how does this work? How do we get Vitamin D from sunlight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wow. So - and if you don't get the sun?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You don't get the Vitamin D?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And equally if you wear sunscreen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happens... What happens to people who don't get enough vitamin D?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So does it matter how light or dark a person's skin is?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ron, why did John McCain reverse course?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have the sands shifted for these two candidates tonight? Do they have to be putting on a different message maybe than we would have seen, I don't know, we could go two weeks ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another day of political uncertainty. Why didn't that translate into a big tumble in the markets today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are we looking at the right place when we pay so much attention to the stock indexes. I mean, are these exchanges really the best barometer of economic unease, or should we be looking somewhere else?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But, what about credit markets?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned earlier, the seizure yesterday of the countries largest thrift Washington Mutual, the biggest bank failure by far in U.S. history, sold now to JPMorgan Chase. On any other day this would be the top story of the day and we're talking to it somewhere in the middle of the broadcast here. What are the lessons do you think? Is this a sign of more to come?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm hm. And what - anything else that we should be looking for in terms of bank failures? Anything down the pike?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me ask you, senator. We were hearing from both sides of the isle that there was progress being made up until the White House meeting yesterday. And it was then that your colleagues, the Republican colleagues in the House side, threw a pretty big wrench into all this - said that they were completely opposed to what was being discussed, and have their alternative plan, which is very far removed from what was agreed on before. What happens to - are you back at square one right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how do you bring the House Republicans on board, then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Senator Greg, what's your estimate on the time table for all of this to work its way through?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Including Republicans?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In your view, is this program legal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You are calling for the CEO's of these telecommunications companies to appear before the Judiciary Committee. What exactly do you want to know from them?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you think this is going to affect General Hayden's prospects for confirmation as the new CIA director? He was the former head of the NSA?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Despite the peace agreement, the humanitarian crisis remains. Is there any sense that the accord will lead to an improvement in the situation in Darfur?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell us, then, a little bit about what the situation is as of today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you know what the situation now is in Kalma, one of the oldest and largest refugee camps there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did the refugees, with all of this happening to them, respond to the news of this peace agreement?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this letter getting much attention in the Arab press?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about this push, finally, for sanctions against Iran by the United States and several European nations? How's that being received there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If and when the bailout passes, the U.S. government will have to do something that nobody has figured out how to do. They'll have to put a dollar value on financial instruments that many on Wall Street call radioactive toxic waste. Well, NPR's Adam Davidson is here to help us understand that challenge. And, Adam, first of all, we're talking about such huge numbers overall, $700 billion, maybe more. How much dothe exact amounts for individual assets really matter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, if they're trying to figure out value for these individual assets, how do they do it, these toxic assets that you're talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, in the absence of a market, as you're describing it now, how are these assets valued right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, looking forward, somebody, or probably a lot of people, are going to have to figure out how to establish a value for these radioactive assets that you're describing. What are they going to do? How do they do that?"}

Fiberglass, the birth control pill, the caterpillar tractor: the men who came up with these revolutionary inventions, will be among those inducted into the National Inventor's Hall of Fame. The ceremonies today and tomorrow in Akron, Ohio, will honor inventors, both living and dead. To find out more about this year's inductees, we turn to Fred Allen, who heads the selection committee. Why don't we start with one example, and this would be a living inventor. His name is Robert Gore. And he invented Gore-Tex. What exactly is it?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you please describe for us the scene there today?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And has the Egyptian government released any information about who exactly might be responsible?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's just start with the question at hand. Would a boycott of ExxonMobil Gas Stations really force that company to lower their gas prices?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What if the boycott worked?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, I mean, basically Mobil wouldn't drop its price so much, you're saying, as customers will go to other gas stations and then they'll up their prices?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...why wouldn't ExxonMobil drop its prices, and why wouldn't that start a war? A price war?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Even in their best interest, in theory, if this was in their best interest?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And did you talk to the parents, and did they cooperate? And how did you handle the students suspected?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So kids are going back to school this morning. What has been the talk over the weekend from both the children and their parents?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, you know, you say here--you didn't expect it to happen to here. Just briefly, what is here? How would you describe your community and this school?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are people talking about why this possibly could have almost happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of the areas Google managed to make a profit in is Internet advertising sales. So what did Google do right that other search engines, like Yahoo and Alta Vista, didn't?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Google has created quite a loyal following of users. How did they do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, but now that Google has mastered--kind of the master of the universe of online searches, they're branching out into other areas. Is there some risk in that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Rob Portman has been U.S. trade representative for 11 months, and you might say just 11 months. Why is the President moving him now out of that job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Congress comes back this week. In terms of the budget and taxes, what do you see happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well given, though, that he's just been appointed, how much leverage or power does he have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And that seems like a tall order?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have any sense of what Rob Portman's strategy would be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. From NPR News, this is All Things Considered. I'm Andrea Seabrook. We start today with a number, 700 billion. That's the federal government's first guess at how much it will cost to clean up the wreckage on Wall Street. In today's show, we'll look at how that wreckage is littered across the financial horizon, from business school to the campaign trail, from New York City to Middle America. First, let's get more details from NPR's Dina Temple-Raston. Dina, government officials are working over this weekend to try and pull together a rescue package for U.S. financial institutions. They're working with members of Congress. What do we know about the plan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how would this plan work to buy back the mortgages?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Bush came out into the Rose Garden to talk a little bit about the proposal today. Let's listen to a little bit of what he said. President GEORGE W. BUSH: The house of cards was much bigger, beyond - sort of stretched beyond just Wall Street in the sense of the effects of failure. And so when one card started to go, we were worried about the whole deck going down, and so therefore moved, and moved hard. And I believe this is going to work. So the president is saying that the financial crisis is not just about Wall Street, and that's why he's asking for the bailout. And where's Congress then, Dina?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The president is asking members of Congress to get this plan passed before they leave for recess, a real recess, the end of the year in Congress. Is that even possible, Dina?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, a disclaimer. NPR is not responsible for damage done by the listener to his or her own body after hearing the following segment. Seriously, though, last month the American Academy of Otolaryngology put out new guidelines on ear cleaning. The rules pretty much boil down to something your mom might tell you. Do not put anything in your ear, certainly not a Q-tip. It's bad for you. So why does it feel so good? That's this week's \"Science Out of the Box.\" I'm in the studio now with Dr. Dennis Fitzgerald. He is an otologist - that's an ear doctor - here in Washington. And Dr. Fitzgerald, why does it feel so good to clean your ears?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why does it feel so good?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Isn't this a lovely conversation? Now, are you going to tell me, Dr. Fitzgerald, that you never put Q-tip in your ear, ever?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now there are, as you know, big problems on the stock market. Google has not been amused. Stock is worth a little bit more than half of what it was late last year. Are you concerned that your board or the investors might get cold feet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Eric Schmidt, you've said that by the year 2030, the U.S. should be using renewable energy for 100 percent of its power generation. Does this kind of partnership represent a step in that direction, and is that a realistic goal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Diane, this is widely described as a bailout. Is that actually the right term?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happens if they don't pay that back at those, as you say, loan shark rates?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, tell me about Edward Liddy. Who is he, and what exactly is his charge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the Federal Reserve said it wanted to avoid a disorderly failure. This is something like the - it seems that they're trying instead to oversee a more controlled dismantling?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Diane, very, very quickly, because I have to let you go. Does that mean the government is on the hook for those insurance policies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So just how popular is moose hunting in Alaska?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, most of us don't encounter moose, if you - particularly if you're city folk and you're down in the Lower 48. What's the hunt like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, you have to dress the moose, immediately, right there where you took him down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Once you actually get the meat back, what do you do with it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Mr. Dilley, I appreciate your candor, though I imagine that it might be a little bit difficult for some of our vegetarian listeners. But I'm going to ask you, what does moose taste like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Moosegetti? Instead of spaghetti, you have moosegetti?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Joe Dilley, it has been a pleasure to talk to you. But I understand that in order to attract the moose, that you use specific moose calls. Before I let you go, do you mind giving us an example of how you might try to call the moose?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what's pushing oil prices down? Is this a temporary dip or something that perhaps is much more permanent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the strength of the dollar also has something to do with this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So crude down by about 25 percent. What can people expect to see at the gas station?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Yergin, help us understand something. Normally, a drop in the price of crude would be good news. But in this case, not everyone is cheering. Why is this seen as a mixed blessing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now some analysts, as you know, are predicting that prices could continue to fall. Some are saying it could fall as much as down to 65, 70 dollars per barrel in the next three to four years. Does that sound right to you? How low might prices go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A new development today in the matter of whether Bisphenol A, or BPA, is safe. BPA is a chemical commonly used in food containers and bottles. A new study suggests that people exposed to lots of BPA are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and heart disease. The study was published this morning in the journal of the American Medical Association just as the FDA convened a meeting on whether it should reassess the chemical. The FDA has said BPA is safe. NPR's Allison Aubrey was at that meeting, and she joins us now in the studio. Allison, first of all, tell us more about this study. What was discussed at this FDA meeting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, does this new paper out today change things, the reassessing against that NOAEL limit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Allison, a question that will take us out of the meeting into people's kitchens and living rooms and, perhaps, the nursery. A lot of consumers are worried about using baby bottles, other containers that have BPA in them. Where does this leave those people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just quickly, before I let you go. How do you know, if you don't see that label, if a container or product has BPA in it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So your advice would be, if there's a shakeup, don't quit too soon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, sticking with this notion of possible forced departure, if you don't quit, and you do get shown the door, what's the best strategy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can it be a situation where you can turn a firing into a badge of honor?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And there's no accusation here that he, himself, would have provided steroids to Bonds, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what is known about him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And did the Giants do anything?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you mentioned Balco, of course; that is the firm that is alleged to have distributed these steroids and other substances to players. Now, we mentioned a perjury investigation involving Barry Bonds. What would the statements be that Barry Bonds made under oath that someone would now be questioning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any documentation suggesting that he did know, suggesting in an affirmative way that whatever happened, he knew what was happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Rosenthal, are you a baseball fan?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And why this different approach to leading the church than when he was still a cardinal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And people have talked about continuity, from Pope John Paul II to Pope Benedict. Where has this Pope taken a different approach on issues, and what issues?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. The company's reported to be looking for a loan of 30 to 40 billion dollars, a bridge loan. What went so wrong at AIG that they should need a loan that big?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, one of the questions raised by AIG's problem is, does it qualify as the kind of entity, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that is simply too big for the U.S. government to allow to fail? Or is it in the same category as Lehman Brothers: big, fabled, but basically on its own?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's say there is no federal loan. What else might there be in the way of saving AIG?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But when Escalus writes about the Persians' defeat, how do you think he's being more emotionally honest than, say, the filmmakers of \"United 93\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sometime back, you wrote a wonderful story called \"The Mother,\" which you said was taken from a comment that your own mother made over dinner at a restaurant with you. She was about 70, and she looked at a waiter, and she said no one will ever touch me again. And one of your characters, I believe, Miriam, says it here, and she fears that. You think that's a fear a lot of us have as we grow older?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what kind of operations are you running in Houston right now, sir?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's that reconnaissance showing? Are you finding people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is it like to rescue people who were supposed to leave and then did not leave?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if someone stays, and you have to rescue them, does that create any sort of fatigue or resentment on the part of the rescue worker?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it didn't use them for walking on land, obviously. What did it use them for, and what kind of motion did it make swimming?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where does this discovery fit in the overall evolution of whales, and how long ago are we talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Richard Stengel, the editor of Time, which is one of the sponsors of the Summit on Service in New York and who wrote a cover story about service for Time last year, proposed among other things having a Cabinet secretary, a national secretary of national service and tripling the size of, say, AmeriCorps. Do those sound like good ideas to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You spoke glowingly the other day of a project in Chicago where people work with former gang members to try to prevent violence, and it reminded me of a - well, Ill say, a cynical comment that a colleague of mine made, which was after the convention last week in St. Paul that you attended and that I covered, would somebody who heard the mocking references to community organizers that were made there think that those people are actually serious about encouraging young people to go in and work with gang members in poor Chicago neighborhoods? Or is that just something you do when youre going to church?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But is he working with people who could qualify as being called community organizers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Normal life. Im just trying to have a mental checklist of normal life here. You will drive again, for example?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And first, is Lehman Brothers, say, the very big investment bank you had in mind, and if we were perhaps midway through the crisis a month ago, are we up to maybe 60 percent through it by now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you say its bloated and consolidation was ahead, in this case, consolidation means what, exactly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I realized that there are lots and lots of properties with mortgages on them. But as a layman, I find this very puzzling. It would seem to me that by now, the banks and the regulators would have at least plumbed the depths of that crisis and come up with a good sense of whos exposed to how much risk of delinquency or default. Have they not done that, and if not, why not? Why does that crisis seem to grow?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, David, these TV shows are free and with no restrictions. And you can get an entire season free. How much of a first is this for the Internet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's a hitch right there. Does anyone really want to sit in front of their computer to watch TV?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, why ABC rather than any other network company?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about, then, other networks? Do you expect that they will follow suit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what in these, in this thinking, is considered to be important enough to trigger a military strike?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about the pros and cons of military action, especially with the U.S. military stretched by Iraq and Afghanistan. For one thing, is it even do-able?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So this consideration of military strikes generally in Iran, is it possible it's just bluster or some sort of psychological campaign, that's why it's coming out now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And finally, what role are other countries playing in all of this, especially Israel, which launched an air strike against a suspected Iraqi nuclear facility 25 years ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this political crisis in Iraq any closer to resolution?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Egypt jumped in to the fray over the weekend. President Hosni Mubarak spoke about the situation in Iraq, and he accused the country's Shiites of loyalty to Iran. He also suggested a civil war had almost started. What's been the reaction there in Baghdad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can you tell us about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So are there foreign countries knocking on the door, waiting to buy up Lehman Brothers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what's changed? What's the big - are they just tapped out, or what's the problem here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if it amounts to an issue of national security - that is, do we want the financial structure of the country to be owned by foreign governments - then how do you go about addressing this problem? Do you address the financial crisis and say, well, let's make it easier for foreign governments to control banks? Or do you say, well, let's just tough it out here and see what happens to our economy because we just can't do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yesterday on the program you told us that many foreign governments see the U.S. as a bit weaker because of the subprime crisis. Is the absence of eager foreign buyers, at least so far as we know for Lehman Brothers, is that more evidence of that phenomenon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Mayor Holden, why is it that so many people there are still without power?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was that a surprise to you that Gustav turned out to be so damaging there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about schools? Are kids back at school?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's happening with traffic?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mayor Holden, what's your biggest worry for the city of Baton Rouge right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Back in March, Mr. Lockhart, you said that the idea of a bailout of Fannie and Freddie was, in your words, nonsense. You said the companies are safe and sound, and they will continue to be safe and sound. How do you explain that just six months later, here we are with the government seizing control of both?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Looking back now, how do you account for the fact that things got this bad? And were you remiss in some ways, the regulator, to let things get to this point where there is now this takeover?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In your statement yesterday, when the seizure was announced, you talked about the inherent conflict and flawed business model that's embedded in the structure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. What do you mean by that? What's the conflict?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think there is something fundamentally - inherently conflicted about the hybrid model that Fannie and Freddie have been, these government-supported enterprises?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you don't think nationalization is the right solution. Do you think privatization could be something you would support?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think the price tag for this takeover is? One number that's been floated is $25 billion. Do you think that's about right? Do you think that's too low?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's your message to Fannie and Freddie stockholders who've now seen their dividend payments eliminated, and they also own a far smaller stake in the companies now. Their shares have been diluted. What do you say to them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it wrenching for you, in any way, to see this happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Adam, one-tenth of China's entire economy has been lent to underwrite these two companies? Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what does today's announcement mean for this highly interdependent relationship?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what about us? Do you think that any changes are contemplated as a result of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Earlier this summer, Congress passed a legislation designed to boost confidence in Fannie and Freddie. How do we get from that legislation to this weekend's reports of a government takeover?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've been talking to people in both the private and public sectors. How sure are they that the government can run Fannie and Freddie better than those companies' CEOs did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, if the government intervention goes through, how can we tell whether it's working?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " March, of course, is the beginning of spring. Is the ice-melt already beginning in March in the Arctic Circle?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said that in recent years we've moved from looking at the possibility that the polar ice could recede to the likelihood that it's actually heading in that direction. What does that mean for sea levels around the world and for the climate in general?"}

Out will pile a group of people who've paid more than $10,000 dollars apiece to run in the annual North Pole Marathon. The founder is Richard Donovan, of Ireland.

Today, offices that workers say make them sick, and houses that are healthy for the environment. We begin with a British study in the current issue of the journal, Occupational and Environmental Medicine. It sets out to find why some workers have symptoms have fatigue and coughing after being in the office. After looking at employees in 44 buildings in London, the authors concluded that it's not always the workplace that makes people sick; it can be the work, and the stress that comes with it. When managers suspect a building may be sick, they might call Howard Brightman, in Boston. He's an industrial hygienist, what you might call a building doctor. A lot of people talk about Sick Building syndrome. It has a certain water cooler quality to it. But what exactly is Sick Building syndrome?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Common?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the researchers who were talking to 4,000 civil servants in London about their environment found that there were some problems with the building, but also that a number of these problems were brought on by people who had problems with their jobs. Effectively, Sick Job syndrome, if you will. Have you come across that sort of thing in your investigation of buildings?"}

We've heard plenty about divisions between Iraq's Sunni and Shiite Muslims. Those divisions have led to many deaths in recent weeks and increased fears of a civil war. This morning, we're going to talk about another divide between Shiites and other Shiites. Most recently, leaders of Iraq's biggest religious group disagreed about whether to keep Ibrahim al-Jafaari as the prime minister. That disagreement pits rival religious parties, each with their own militias, against each other. Today, we called Edward Wong, a reporter for the New York Times in Baghdad. Mr. Wong, deep are the differences between various Shiite groups?"}

Joining me now from Bangkok is NPR Southeast Asia correspondent, Michael Sullivan. Hello. MICHAEL SULLIVAN reporting: Hello, Renee. What is at stake there in Thailand, of course, but also maybe generally?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " How's it look from up there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the view of the storm from above may be majestic, but on the ground in New Orleans concern grows. In a few minutes, voluntary evacuations have begun, almost three years to the day since Katrina hit. But to politics now. Republican John McCain's on the road to the GOP convention next week along with his unconventional choice of a running mate. McCain surprised almost everyone yesterday when he announced he'd chosen the little-known governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. McCain and Palin have been traveling by bus through Midwestern battleground states. Tonight they're holding a rally in Washington, Pennsylvania, and that's where we find NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, how are people responding to the choice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, just in the 30 seconds we've got left. If she was a choice made to appeal to women voters, from what you seen today, does that seem to be the case? Is it working?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thank you very much. NPR's Scott Horsley. Governor Palin has sued the federal government trying to reverse the decision to put the polar bear on the threatened species list. Plain says there isn't enough evidence to support that lifting. She says the lifting could harm oil and gas development and she says climate model showing the continued loss of sea ice are unreliable. But this week, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reports that sea ice is at its second-lowest level since they started keeping records three decades ago, and could reach an all-time record low within weeks. And as sea ice shrinks, that puts polar bears in trouble. Earlier this month, government scientists flying over Alaska's Chuck Chi Sea spotted 10 polar bears swimming in open water, an unusually high number. Yesterday, Margaret Williams flew out over the Arctic Ocean with the Coast Guard looking for polar bears. Williams directs the Alaska office of the World Wildlife Fund, and she joins us from Anchorage. Ms. Williams, what did you see out there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So that was one sighting. Did you see other polar bears in the Water, too?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You do see projections about summer sea ice, that there could be no summer sea ice at all in anywhere from five to maybe 20, 25 years. I've heard it referred to as a death spiral. What did it look like from above? What were you seeing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why? What was it that the CIA was trying to get out of Nosenko?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " After that, what became of Nusenko?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That borders on the vicious, actually, and he very well may have deserved it. I guess you kind of figure he did, when you read it. Is there one that's more sweetly honest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about the end of that final event, the 1,500 meters. You collapsed onto the track on your back. You have, I think, three other decathletes sprawled all around you, completely spent. Were you able to savor what you had just done?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your coaches said that you hate the 1,500 meters, that final event, after all the others that you've had to go through, and you got first place in a number of them, in the 100 meters, the long jump, the discus.

NPR's Don Gonyea is traveling with Senator Obama. Hi Don, how's that Wisconsin barbecue?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any speculation about why Eau Claire and why a place like the Rod and Gun Park?"}

You'll be meeting next month with Army General David Petraeus. You'll be addressing the British House of Commons in October. You've experienced this violence firsthand. You were kidnapped yourself by the Taliban, threatened with death in a couple of fatwas. And you're trying to put schools in these areas that are this hostile and this volatile? How do you do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Greg, this has been a week in which editorials have been sounding the alarm about Afghanistan and the news of these deaths and military operations have hit the front pages.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, when conservatives hear Democrats talk about being progressive, they say that's just a way of avoiding saying liberal, that it's an evasion, it means the same thing. What do you say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As best as I understand the ideas underlying the Obama campaign, it's not merely that they are very novel, new solutions that we might apply to problems. It's that the way Washington operates and the influence of lobbies in Washington makes it impossible for the executive and legislative branches to actually act on these problems and enact the solutions that are before them. Do you buy that? That there's something broken about the relationship between Washington and lobbyists and special interests?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I assume that his contributions are unwelcome at the Obama campaign because they don't want any money from lobbyists. Are lobbyists what the problem is in Washington?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, I should - I'll leave the subject. But before doing so I should, I think in the interest of full disclosure say, that on brother's list of clients, National Public Radio is actually included. I don't know what they did for us, but they represent lots of folks. You write about the - well, the forerunners of the progressive party, the populists, who famously looking at the inequalities in American life in the Gilded Age, urged that federal government become bigger and stronger to come to the aid of American citizens and to bring about some kind of social justice. I've been in Washington now for 32 years, and I've heard presidents of both parties many times explain how great it is that we're in the era of small government, and that the days of the government getting bigger are thankfully behind us. Do you think the American public is at a point where it's willing to regard Washington as its agent, which might - if strengthened and enlarged - be stronger and bigger on its behalf as opposed to a problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm very well. Now, Mr. Melendez, we just heard from your counterpart in the state Republican Party that the race is tightening in Minnesota, not just in the rural areas, but in and around the Twin Cities metropolitan area, and that's very curious because that's usually a Democratic stronghold. What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've got a very tight Senate race in Minnesota right now between the incumbent Norm Colman and challenger Al Franken. How does that factor into the presidential race? Is Franken a drag on the Obama ticket?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, there's going to be quite a bit of enthusiasm surrounding the Republican Party in just a few weeks with the Republican National Convention there in the Twin Cities. Are you at all worried or concerned about a possible bump for the John McCain ticket if the Minnesota governor, Tim Pawlenty, actually becomes his running mate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John Kerry ultimately carried Minnesota, but he did it by basically spending a lot of time there and making an 11th-hour visit to the state right before the presidential election. What will Barack Obama have to do to make sure that Minnesota is in the Democrat's category?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's the idea of polling workers taking the machines home with them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ms. Dibble, I'm just wondering before I let you go, I was just curious whether, apart from the logistics of all this on Election Day, where do you put the voting machines, how do you get them to the polling place at the right time - do you think that for poll workers, there might be just a little civic pride involved in being the keeper of the voting machines for a couple of days at home and the dimension of all this that is maybe not entirely rational but has been of some benefit to people all these years to feel that responsibility?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Tracey, let's turn now to the negative ads. We've talked on this program in the past about negative ads from John McCain. They've been typically announced with great fanfare, but the Obama campaign has been quietly rolling out their negative ads. This one debuted a few weeks ago. It's been airing in battleground states. Let's listen. Unidentified Man #3: For decades, he's been Washington's biggest celebrity. Unidentified Man #4: John McCain. Unidentified Man #3: And as Washington embraced him, John McCain hugged right back, the lobbyists running his low-road campaign Now again, we said they've been quietly rolling these ads out in key battleground states. What do you make of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you expect that a potential successor reasonably would be more or less sympathetic to U.S. foreign policy, or would they also have to do the kind of straddling Mr. Musharraf did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what do you see new leadership doing in the border areas? Because of course that porous border that we hear so much about has allowed militants to regroup. Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does new leadership have clean hands on the matter in a way Mr. Musharraf didn't?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do they put in the water down there that makes people run so fast?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, President Obasanjo has never said he would run again, were the constitution to change, but would there be an argument, though, for keeping continuity at the presidential level, and the argument being that a vote might further deepen the divide between the Muslim North and the Christian South?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " The body of Slobodan Milosevic is being released to his family today or tomorrow and will be buried in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. The former Yugoslav president and war crimes defendant died on Saturday in his cell in the Hague. The U.N. War Crimes Tribunal announced that the cause was a heart attack. But Milosevic was apparently taking medication his doctors had not prescribed. The death of Milosevic leaves his victims believing justice has been thwarted, and it leaves his fellow Serbs divided over his legacy. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is in Belgrade and she joins me now. And Sylvia, Milosevic has not been well for a long time, and his four-year trial was frequently interrupted because of his health problems. So his fellow Serbs are also asking, you know, why he died. SYLVIA POGGIOLI reporting: Absolutely. In fact, you know, a month ago he had asked to go to Russia for special treatment, but the tribunal denied it. Now, all the newspapers here are giving lots of coverage to a letter Milosevic's lawyer said his client wrote to the Russian Embassy just the day before his died. According to the lawyer, Milosevic believed he was being poisoned, and in fact a test two weeks ago had shown traces in Milosevic's blood of an antibiotic used for leprosy and tuberculosis and which apparently blunts the effect of medicines Milosevic had been prescribed by his doctors for his heart and blood pressure problems. In his letter, Milosevic said he had never taken any antibiotics in five years. The letter and the blood tests raise enormous questions, so even in death Milosevic succeeds in leaving a trail of turmoil. And questions about how he died aside, what's been the reaction there in Belgrade to the news of his death?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the current Serbian president has ruled out a state funeral for Milosevic, former president there. Will there be a funeral?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Belgrade. From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Andrea Seabrook. Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev signed a formal cease-fire with neighboring Georgia today. The deal was mediated by the president of France. The American president responded from his ranch in Crawford, Texas. President Bush said this means Russia must immediately withdraw its forces from Georgian territory and from the two breakaway regions where this conflict ignited. President GEORGE W. BUSH: There's no room for debate on this matter. The United Nations Security Council has adopted numerous resolutions concerning Georgia. These resolutions are based on the premise that South Ossetia and Abkhazia remain within the borders of Georgia. Moscow, though, says it has to take extra security measures before starting a pullout. We turn to NPR's Ivan Watson. He's in Georgia's capital of Tbilisi. And, Ivan have you seen any sign of a Russian withdrawal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you've spoken with some of the Russian soldiers you came across today. What are they saying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you're in Tbilisi. Can you tell at all what Russia's strategy looks like from where you sit there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what are Georgians saying about the Russian occupation there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, to another country where people are trying to figure out what's really going on, Pakistan. Here's what we know: the parties in the country's ruling coalition are moving to impeach President Pervez Musharraf. We also know talks have been going on about a deal to let Musharraf quit rather than face impeachment. But that's about all we know for sure. There have been some reports that Musharraf could resign in the next few days, though his spokesman says Musharraf's staying put. NPR's Philip Reeves is in Pakistan's capital of Islamabad trying to figure this all out. And, Phil, is Musharraf really about to quit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I understand that Musharraf's spokesman says that he will stay -Musharraf will stay and fight impeachment. What happens if he does that?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're saying you would hear this just in conversation if somebody needs encouragement, (Chinese spoken)?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " NBC, are you listening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm looking at a map that was published in an Estonian paper, and without the benefit of knowing Estonia, and I can't read the legend, but it certainly appears to show Estonian readers how Russia would go about invading your country. Is that a common fear in Estonia today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That point, though, Georgia has aspired to membership in NATO, and while President Saakashvili often appears beside the flag of the European Union, Georgia is not a member. Do you feel that membership in those organizations do guarantee the safety and ensure the security of Estonia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But does it mean to you that you assume Europe and for that matter the United States would respond differently to a conflict between Estonia and Russia than it has responded to Georgia and Russia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It appears that in the cease-fire agreement mediated by France, the Russians were permitted a clause that permits them to, and I quote, implement additional security measures. Some read that as a loophole that allows for the Russian army to do what it wants in Georgia right now. Did the French and - the French acting on behalf of the European Union, did they let people down in that mediation effort?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Before I let you go, does what you're seeing in Georgia this week, despite your very vocal opposition to it and that of other leaders of countries that used to be in the Soviet Union, does it in some way threaten to alter policy, even if subtly, and make people feel we should be more cautious, we should do nothing that might be so reckless as to give Moscow a pretext to bully us?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you got out of the pool, your mother was there at the Water Cube. Did you look for her in the stands? Could you find her?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now more on the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili. He's young, 40 years old, educated in the West, with law degrees from George Washington University and Columbia. He worked for a New York law firm in the '90s before going back to Georgia to enter politics. Saakashvili is multilingual, with a Dutch wife, and his model for Georgia is that of a Western-style democracy. He has said he's proud of his American values. Stephen Sestanovich at the Council on Foreign Relations has met with President Saakashvili frequently over the last decade, and what are your most recent impressions from the last meeting, say, that you had with him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that Saakashvili overplayed his hand with these separatist areas? Was he overconfident, maybe, in his support from the West, and did he underestimate what Russia's response would be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can you tell us about the level of animosity leading up to this point between Saakashvili and Vladimir Putin?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you studied sighted and blind athletes at the 2004 Olympics and Paralympics. What did you find?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " The deal of course has to be approved by regulators. Just briefly, will they approve this deal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In today's column, you invoke a chilling analogy. Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union and its loss of global power is like Germany defeated after World War I. How are they similar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Not to belabor the analogy too much, as you would say, in the 1930s, the U.S., Britain and France will have been faulted by historians for failing to contain similar ambitions of Nazi Germany. What should those same countries and the rest of Western Europe be doing now to confront Russia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The president of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, said today: So far, we have got from the West moral support and humanitarian aid, but we need more than that to stop what he called this barbaric aggression. What can they realistically expect?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But even a united vocal response wouldn't necessarily carry consequences for Moscow. Should there be a threat of sanction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Georgia is small, a population under five million. It's remote. It's near the easternmost fringe of the West. Ukraine is also a former Soviet republic. It's big. It has a population of more than 45 million, and it's also been increasingly democratic in recent years. Would the fact of Russian - let's say Russia acting with impunity in Georgia be a green light in Moscow to do similar things in Ukraine?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're in Moscow. How's this playing out there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the way this conflict unfolded reveal anything about the power relationship between Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitri Medvedev?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how are those projects doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The thing that I wonder about is the long tail of money that is spent on this kind of thing, you know. Remember after the attacks they started irradiating all of Congressional mail for this stuff. So they'd send all the mail, reroute it out to the Midwest somewhere, irradiate it there and send it back to the members of Congress. They're still doing that. I mean people don't remember, that's a huge cost, it's a governmental cost, that it's still all being irradiated. They still cut off the corner of all the letters and shake any powder out of it, seven years later. So are there things that we're doing now that are, that was an overwhelming response to what might've been not an overwhelming attack?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So David, I guess it comes down to the bottom line, which is, are we as Americans safer than we were when these attacks first happened seven years ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " To Bolivia now where President Evo Morales faced a recall referendum today. It was the most serious challenge since he took office two years ago. Final results aren't in yet. Polls have just closed, but the referendum has exposed sharp divisions in Bolivia between those who support the president's socialist agenda and those who worry he's concentrating too much power in his own hands. NPR's Juan Forero is in the capital, La Paz. Juan, what do we know about the vote so far?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Morales is expected to survive then, yeah?"}

It certainly looks like war between Russia and its neighbor, Georgia. The two sides are battling for control of the breakaway province of South Ossetia. A senior American official in Moscow says the Russians are using strategic bombers and ballistic missiles to hit targets inside Georgia. Casualty figures are sketchy. The Russians say 1,500 people have died. NPR's Ivan Watson just made it to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, and Ivan, I understand you drove up from the Turkish border. What did you see?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you're in Tbilisi, which I understand is about an hour from where the heaviest fighting is?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ivan, could you just give us a quick sketch of the roots of this conflict?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, let's go through some numbers here. How much is the United States in the hole?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now both candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, have laid out some of their budget proposals on their Web sites. They're not terribly specific. McCain says he will have a balanced budget by 2013, largely by cutting spending. What do you think of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how does someone like you hear it when McCain says no new taxes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's turn to Obama now. He says he'll reinstate pay-as-you-go rules in budgeting in the Congress. He also says he'll stop the Iraq War and use that money to pay down deficits anyway. What do you think of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which plan's better, Obama's or McCain's?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've been talking throughout these conversations this week about the impact of the presidential vote on Senate races across the country. And John McCain has done well in New Hampshire in the past. He won the primaries there both in 2000 and also this year. Do you think his history in your state could affect and could benefit John Sununu?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. One day before China's big moment, the Olympic opening ceremonies, a dull haze hung over Beijing. Tomorrow, thousands of athletes will march into the city's main stadium, known as the Bird's Nest. The Olympic Games provide China with a chance to show the world how much it has achieved in a remarkably brief period of time. But, like the haze, questions about air pollution and strict security crackdowns hover over the festivities. NPR's Howard Berkes joins us from Beijing to set the Olympic scene for us, and Howard, let's start first with a question of pollution. We know that China's been taking a lot of extraordinary measures to try to clear the air. Has it worked?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Howard, what about the protests that have taken place so far in Beijing? We've heard about demonstrators who were arrested outside the Bird's Nest Stadium, also at Tiananmen Square. Are you starting to see a greater show of force out on the street to discourage protests at the Olympics?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what have you learned about Bruce Ivins' possible motives?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's leading them in that direction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you learned anything else about any anti-abortion activity within the family?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Still, Dina, a lot of what you're describing is circumstantial evidence that could easily be explained away if Bruce Ivins were alive to defend himself. Is the FBI over-reaching here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Bruce Ivins' lawyer has complained about heavy-handed tactics by the FBI. They say they basically hounded his client to commit suicide. What does the FBI say about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the fear here that a lot of the homes will be torn down in that part of St. Bernard Parish will become green space of some kind. Is that true?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When this process is all over, do you expect St. Bernard Parish to be a radically different place than it was before Hurricane Katrina?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's start with a basic question. First, how much of the average American's wealth is tied up in their home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what happens now if prices stop going up, or start going down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. Let's go a little deeper in the dismal science here. How does anybody figure out, or at least make a reasonable prediction of whether a change in housing prices would affect consumer spending?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Meyer, I've read that there's a climber from Nepal on your expedition who did reach the summit and got safely back to base camp. What did he say about what happened up there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what did he tell you about the climbers who were not able to make it down? Did he see what happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm sure this is always a question in mountain climbing. If you see other climbers in trouble, and you're in trouble yourself, do you stop to help them out or do you keep going?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Meyer, you're an experienced mountaineer yourself. Do you think, looking back now, were there too many people trying to summit at the same time? Was experience an issue here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, are they crazy? I mean, why would they summit in those conditions, or try to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Meyer, as you think about leaving K2 now, obviously this was far from the climb that you would have imagined. Does it change how you feel about mountaineering, about climbing, about possibly coming back to K2?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think your visa was revoked? What explanation were you given?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You have been quite outspoken on that. You wrote an op-ed back in May calling China the genocidal regime's key defender at the United Nations. Do you think that did get you in trouble?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that include athletes from the U.S.?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What were your plans for Beijing? Had you planned to be speaking out on this issue?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, this decision not to close the case, what's going on there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have you learned about what kind of evidence the FBI has gathered against Bruce Ivins?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what would the relevance of that be, what sort of thing in his messy personal life might be tied to this investigation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ari, I gather you've been fleshing out the biography of Bruce Ivins. What have you learned?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. This week, the Olympic torch will take its triumphant homecoming tour through Beijing before the games begin on Friday. Two thousand miles away, in far western China, a dramatically different scene - riot police are out in force in the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar. They're stopping cars and buses, searching bags, and according to exiled dissident groups, police are rounding up and beating local Muslims. The security clampdown comes after a bold daytime attack on Monday. According to Chinese authorities, two men armed with knives and explosives ambushed a police unit, killing 16 officers and wounding 16 more. Chinese authorities call it a terrorist attack, and they arrested two young men at the scene. Washington Post correspondent Jill Drew is in Kashgar. And Jill, what else have you learned about what happened in this attack on Monday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the Chinese government is blaming a Uighur separatist group for this attack, called the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. What can you tell us about that group?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What else are you hearing from people on the streets about these attacks and what followed the crackdown there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a visible police presence throughout the city as well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've heard both John McCain and Barack Obama speak many, many times before. What are you hoping to learn, and as you think about your questions, what are you hoping to ask that might elicit some new information or some side of the candidates we haven't seen before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are those still non-negotiable issues for you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But would you be sending out that same list now in 2008?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's interesting because we've been hearing a lot this election cycle about evangelical voters who are not galvanizing around a Republican candidate, who are looking for an alternative. Can you imagine Barack Obama cutting into the evangelical vote in a way that John Kerry, Al Gore did not? Do you see him doing something different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said that Barack Obama is comfortable with the language of faith. Do you think John McCain is also comfortable with that language of faith?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that a problem, do you think, for evangelical voters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you see any sort of split or division between older evangelical voters and the younger generation coming up and the issues that are of concern to them, the issues that they'll vote on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do you think that ultimately would translate to a shift at the ballot box?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Pastor Rick Warren, who will be hosting a forum on leadership and compassion with Senators Barack Obama and John McCain at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California on August 16th. From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Andrea Seabrook. Government investigators say they were still several major legal steps away from indicting Dr. Bruce Ivins as a suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks. Ivins is the army scientist who committed suicide last week. NPR's Dina Temple-Raston covers the FBI for NPR, and she joins me now in the studio. Dina, we've heard for days now that Ivins was just about to be indicted before he died. What have you learned?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, and that led to Steven Hatfield initially being a person of interest. Let me ask you, does Ivins' suicide mean that the case is now closed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if the case is closed then, will we learn what the FBI actually had on the guy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to ask about how you work in your clinic. Let's say you're in an exam room, you're with a patient who's been diagnosed with HIV what do they tell you about what they tell their families and how their families react to them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that make it hard for them or do you find that that translates into a less-than-perfect drug regimen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Ogle, you've been an infectious disease doctor for more than 20 years. How do you meet this problem head on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's a newly discovered painting by Vincent Van Gogh. It had been sitting in storage at a museum in the Netherlands. But the portrait wasn't lost in some dusty corridor. It was hidden under the paint of another Van Gogh, and it was revealed by a giant X-ray machine. Now, that's Science Out of the Box. Koen Janssens' head of the international team of researchers that uncovered the hidden painting. He's in Antwerp, Belgium. Mr. Janssens, Van Gogh often painted over his older works. What you found was underneath a painting called Patch of Grass. What does this new painting look like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand that art historians knew for many years that there was something underneath this painting. What did you do differently that they didn't do to uncover the actual painting or reveal the actual painting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of the most amazing things is that you have an idea of the colors Van Gogh used in the portrait. How did you figure that out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you know where the portrait might fit in with the evolution of Van Gogh as an artist?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The king has vowed to reform the government, even hold popular elections for parliament - in 2010. Just can't seem to put down that scepter. Until then, the poor island nation has to face a king-sized coronation party bill. The festivities cost Tonga two and a half million U.S. dollars. That, of course, was the Tongan national anthem. The president of the Philippines, Gloria Arroyo, has declared a state of emergency. She says her government has foiled an attempted coup. But Arroyo says the Philippines still faces a clear threat from treasonist forces. Police have used fire hoses and batons to disperse crowds marking the anniversary of a coup 20 years ago that toppled Ferdinand Marcos. We're going to go now to Marites Vitug, editor of the Philippines magazine Newsbreak, who is on the line from Manila. Good morning, welcome to the program. Or good day, I should say. It may not be morning where you are. What is your president saying about this coup? How is it being described?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And why say that there's still a threat if people have been foiled, people have been arrested?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So one person is in custody. What is the evidence against this person?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it clear to you that there really was a coup attempt though?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what does a state of emergency mean exactly in the Philippines?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I have to ask about these demonstrations and the way that police have put them down. This is the 20th anniversary of what is marked in the United States or remembered in the United States as a happy event, a glorious event, the ousting of a dictator. Why would police crack down on people celebrating that 20 years later?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does President Arroyo have popular support?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sir, people have been raising the possibility of an all out civil war in Iraq following this mosque attack and the reprisals for it. Are you concerned about a civil war?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that this week's major event, the bombing of the Shiite shrine, the Golden Dome in Samarra, was an attempt to cause a civil war?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you saying that you are going to accuse Shiites of destroying one their own must important shrines, sir?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Foreign intelligence from outside?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Given that this attack on the Shiite shrine took place in mostly Sunni city, where Iraqi insurgents who are associated with Sunnis have been very active, don't you think it's possible that a Sunni group might be responsible or that al-Qaeda in Iraq, which has been supported by some Sunnis, might be responsible?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this a moment of greater tension, do you think, then at previous tense moments in the last three years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Samarra, the scene of the attack on the shrine, remains violent despite multiple attempts by U.S. forces to root out insurgents there. Knight Ridder reporter Tom Lassiter recently spent two weeks in Samarra imbedded with U.S. troops, and he's online the line from Iraq. And Mr. Lassiter, did the attack on the mosque surprise you at all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And why has it been difficult to recruit local Iraqis in Samarra to serve in security forces?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the U.S. troops that you spent time with, what is their role in a difficult situation like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In your reporting you quoted an officer who said that Samarra is an example of many Iraqi towns that are barely functioning. Is that in fact the case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's where the grenade came from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the circumstances in which Congress, historically, has gained greater power, as opposed to the executive taking greater power?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And tomorrow, we'll meet a former White House lawyer who's opinions backed up an expansive view of the President's power. NPR's Jamie Tarabay joins us now from Baghdad. And first, Jamie, how did insurgents, or whoever may have been behind this, commit this attack?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which helps to explain why there have already been protests here. Is this seen as even more significant than other deadly attacks against Shiites and Shiite targets?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " People saying that peaceful protest will not be enough. And I have to ask, given the leaders you just mentioned, this is a time when Shiite Muslims, to some degree, have been arguing among themselves over who will control the country, and how the country will be controlled. Do you suddenly have a situation where Shiites are united, but maybe not in a good way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But with the deficit as high as it is right now, is it responsible to propose something that's likely to increase deficit spending?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Before I let you go, Senator, I just want to ask you about this sparring that's been going on back and forth between the two campaigns. Yesterday, the John McCain campaign accused you of playing the race card. This morning, one of your top strategists, David Axelrod, acknowledged that you were referring to race, among other things, when you talked about how you present a different image than the faces that we now see on our currency, on our $1 bills and on our $5 bills. I just want to be clear about what you were trying to say in that comment. How has the GOP or the McCain campaign been using scare tactics, particularly when it comes to race?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, I think I heard you say that you think that they might be trying to exploit this because of the speed with which they reacted to your statements, because race is such a tricky thing. You yourself acknowledged that in your speech in Philadelphia. To the extent that they do try to exploit this, how do you inoculate that? How do you, as a candidate in a historical position, given that some Americans may feel some discomfort about crossing that historical threshold, how do you deal with that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First of all, as we just heard, Senator McCain admits that he doesn't much use e-mail, and he's just now starting to use the Internet. Do you think his reluctance to use technology on a very personal basis will have any effect on the way he uses or even encourages technology on a public policy level?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What role should the federal government play in guaranteeing broadband access, particularly in rural communities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Barack Obama has talked about creating, if elected, in his administration some sort of technology czar. Is this the kind of thing that John McCain would also be considering?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Michael Powell is an adviser on technology for the John McCain campaign. He was chairman of the FCC from 2001 to 2005. You've probably seen these people walking down the street a lot lately, and by these people we mean the ones with their eyes focused on their cell phone or BlackBerry, thumbs all aflutter as they fire off text messages, totally oblivious to their surroundings. Maybe you're one of them. Text-walkers have become a symbol of the multi-tasking age, but they can be a danger to themselves and to others. At least one state, Illinois, is considering a fine to curtail the behavior. Joining me on the line is Angela Gardner. She's an emergency doctor at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Dr. Gardner, I take that text-walking is enough of a problem that the American College of Emergency Physicians issued an alert about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kinds of things are you seeing and hearing about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did either person involved in that accident walk away from this saying, I will never text-walk again?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Doctor, now you mentioned an anecdotal example, but are there any kind of statistics to suggest that there is a veritable uptick in these injuries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, aside from not doing it, from putting away the phone or the BlackBerry, what are some things that people can do to be a safe text-walker if they insist on walking while texting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now we mentioned one state, Illinois, is now considering making text-walking a misdemeanor, a misdemeanor that would be worth a $25 fine. Do you think that might make a difference?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you ever text-walk?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Ivan, when the government is accused of anti-secular activities, what does that mean, exactly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the ruling party has not been banned. What's the reaction been to this ruling today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think, Ivan, that this ruling means that the ruling party needs to change anything about the way it operates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We're talking about this in part because of some campaign bickering that took place last week. Barack Obama announced he'd already appointed a transition team. They were working sort of behind the scenes. John McCain said that was like dancing in the end zone before Obama had even reached the 50-yard line. What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there presidential transitions that have not been properly planned for and therefore has resulted in not-so-great first couple months?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " After that's decided, does that vetting apparatus turn towards those other possible top appointees?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I know you have called for public funding, at least some public funding, for presidential transitions. Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it more difficult for a transition to take place when there is also a shift in party?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In Turkey today, a pair of bombs ripped through a residential neighborhood of Istanbul. More than a dozen people were killed and scores injured. NPR's Ivan Watson is on the line now from Istanbul. Ivan, what do you know about these explosions?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why is it a good thing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, so if the tiger in the modern world is, say, an interview with Kevin Costner that I'm not going to run from and have to sit across the table from the man, those Cortisol levels just stay high?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what exactly happens when the Cortisol is in your blood? What does it do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you're coming up something like a pill that could help people keep their cells healthy and happy and young?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how does it work? There are so many video games on there, who plays what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And of course unlike a track meet, the players are actually just sitting down the whole time, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, DJ Wheat, I don't have any idea what you're talking about. What's a teleport?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I gather the people sitting up in the bleachers, they get to see it on a big screen, what's going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now do the players get salaries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it does take quite a bit of skill and practice and, you know, hand-eye coordination to play these games at that level, but when I see people playing with that much hand-eye coordination, I sit there, and I think man, he should go be a fighter pilot. What's he doing playing video games with that skill?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You wrote a column about this. What can regular homeowners get?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, how does that work? The government gives me a loan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about veterans returning home from war?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. So, if they're just coming out, they're coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan, they're having a little trouble, they don't get foreclosed on immediately?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the sculptures of?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, how can you tell that the fake ones are fake?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what's different about the forgeries? What's the stylistic difference?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How can you tell?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did the Brooklyn Museum go about buying these if, as you say, some of them are really bad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you do exactly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And which direction was it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. Now, let's step back for just a quick second. Your specialty is examining this kind of quandary, correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Professor Olson, when did Caesar land in Britain?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Professor Olson, I have to ask: four days' difference?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does that matter much?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " David Weinberger is at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. You can read about other possible VP choices for John McCain and Barack Obama at NPR.org. This week, an enormous political football bounced through Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency punted. The question is, will the federal government stand by its mandate for ethanol in the nation's gasoline, or will it grant Texas a waiver, cutting the amount of ethanol it would need in half? That question has potentially huge economic consequences for corn growers and other farmers, cattlemen and other livestock producers, consumers, environmentalists, motorists, oil companies, international food aid groups, you name it. And here to talk about this question is Margie Kriz, energy and environmental correspondent for National Journal. Margie, first of all the mandate. What does the mandate say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Price of corn has gone up. People who raise corn have done pretty well. Texas Governor Rick Perry wants a waiver for his state from the mandate. What does that mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds like an incredible brawl involving all sorts of hugely powerful Washington lobbies, but does it really - is the final say really with the EPA, or can the Congress overrule whatever the administration does about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do we know when EPA is going to announce its decision in this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here's a sentence that could have not escaped Barack Obama's attention as he prepared to visit Israel: Israel will almost surely attack Iran's nuclear sites in the next four to seven months. Those were the opening words of an op-ed piece in last Friday's New York Times. The author was Israeli historian Benny Morris, who joins us now from Israel. And Professor Morris, first, in a nutshell, why would Israel preempt whatever diplomatic efforts might be under way to prevent Iran from going nuclear?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why the time frame four to seven months?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You describe this as a view, a view of the Iranian threat, that's shared by Israelis of nearly all political stripes. I mean, why wouldn't Israelis assume instead that their own nuclear arsenal could deter Iran's potential nuclear arsenal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you imagine anything happening between now and next January that would make this unlikely that, as you wrote, Israel will almost surely attack Iran's nuclear site in the next four to seven months? Is there something that could underscore that almost, and it might turn Israel around?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now I know this kind of relocation has been done along the Mississippi River after flooding. Is it voluntary to relocate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I think that we might be getting closer to understanding how an important thing is going to be done here. People have been wondering how, if at all, will the government try to prevent people from rebuilding in what are seen as hopelessly dangerous neighborhoods. It sounds like you're not going to use the stick of actually forcing people to relocate, but you're going to use the carrot of offering to pay if they do relocate. Is that right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does this mean it will be impossible for some people to rebuild in the places that they were before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One last thing. If Congress does not give you as money as you're hoping for, as the White House is asking for, what do you do then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is there any way Plushenko can lose tonight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What makes him so good, Christine?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me just give some information here. Essentially, there are two laws that contradict each other, or seem to. The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, prohibits domestic eavesdropping without court approval. On the other hand, the administration says that Congress gave the president wide authority after September 11th. So, are you saying, the vote after 9/11 to let the president use military force, trumps the older law?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But in arguing that intelligence can be folded into a statute authorizing the use of military of force, it seems by that logic that one could listen to purely domestic communications, or read citizens' mail, if that was thought to be going overseas. Under that logic, what couldn't the federal government do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But theoretical as it may be, under this interpretation of yours having to do with surveillance, could the government, or could the government not read citizens' mail?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The fact that the program's existence has been made public, what is the reason not to go back to Congress and get some sort of congressional authorization?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you saying you won't go back to Congress?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, this program still must be reauthorized by the attorney general every 45 days. Could your office recommend that it not be reauthorized?"}

Those are at NPR.org. In Zimbabwe today, a development that could lead to the end of a political crisis. President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai have signed a deal to set the terms for formal talks, and they've agreed to start talking. Those negotiations would be aimed at creating a power-sharing government. It was the first time in a decade that the two men have met face to face. The recent presidential race between the two involved brutal attacks, largely by Mugabe supporters, and the killings of dozens of people working for the opposition. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is following this story and joins us now. And Ofeibea, what agreement exactly did Mugabe and Tsvangirai sign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Like you literally can't see what's in front of you? Lt. Col. GROSSMAN: Well, the eyes revert to what I call the default survival position, basically two headlight beams shining in the distance. You lose near vision, peripheral vision, depth perception. Hearing. Most people in combat don't hear their shots, or if they do hear them, they've very muted, and their ears don't ring afterwards. Hunters are familiar with this. It appears to be a stress response or even a killing dynamic. Another dynamic that happens is slow-motion time. I've interviewed thousands who have been in combat, law enforcement and military, and many say they can see the bullet leave the barrel. It's not like \"The Matrix,\" where the bullet crawls past, but it is where the bullets slow down enough, like paint ball, that you can actually track it with the eyes, and we know that it's actually happening. So how do you teach these soldiers to deal with all of this? It doesn't sound like you could possibly continue to be rational. Lt. Col. GROSSMAN: Yeah, there is a powerful tendency to respond to combat the way you think you should respond. If you've been told for a lifetime that combat will destroy you, then it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. What I teach is what I call the No Macho Man, No Pity Party. Do not create an expectation there will be a problem, but if there is a problem, go get help. We talk about post traumatic stress disorder. PTSD occurs when there's two things, a life-and-death event, and your response to that life-and-death event is intense fear, helplessness and horror. If there is no fear, helplessness and horror, there is no PTSD. So from the very beginning, understanding fear, controlling fear, being prepared for fear is a vital part, and we're learning more every day. Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman. He's a psychology professor at West Point, and he wrote the book, \"On Combat: The Psychology and Physiology of Deadly Conflict in War and in Peace.\" Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Andrea Seabrook. The Library of Congress chose a new poet laureate this past week. Her name, Kay Ryan, and if she were sitting in this chair right now, she'd do the whole hour in like a minute. That's how compact her poems are, how full her language is. Kay Ryan, are you ready for the job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what is the job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of my favorites of your poems is called \"Home to Roost.\" Would you read it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " To keep things sparse but powerful?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it just seems like a poet of your stature teaching remedial English?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That image called \"Migrant Mother\" is one of the most-reproduced photographs in history. Dorothea Lange took it in California in 1936. She had a job working for one of the New Deal agencies, the Farm Security Administration. I wonder: Why did the government send out photographers to those places?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You focus on the year 1939, after she took \"Migrant Mother.\" Why 1939?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you turn to one of those photos?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We came across a quote of Dorothea Lange talking about what motivates her. She said no country has ever closely scrutinized itself visually that I know of. I know what we could make of it if people only thought we could dare look at ourselves. What's your favorite picture?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Andrea Seabrook. First today, a carefully choreographed diplomatic dance in Geneva, Switzerland. Representatives of the United States and Iran sat down at the same table. It was a breakthrough moment. Words were spoken, views exchanged, but however you describe the events, do not call them negotiations. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is in Geneva. Sylvia, any concrete results?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So they have two more weeks, though. Is that progress in the situation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Williams Burns was the lead American diplomat here, but he wasn't actively negotiating with the Iranians. What role did he play?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was there reaction from Iranians?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does an American diplomat even begin to negotiate with an enemy country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you send a note through the diplomatic channels there, and then they send it along?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ambassador Lord, in the current presidential campaign, there's been a pretty stark difference between the candidates on this issue. Senator Barack Obama says he would talk directly with America's enemies, specifically Iran. Hillary Clinton called that naive. Later, John McCain and President Bush also criticized the stance. When do you think it's appropriate to talk with an enemy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Usually, when I talk to our movie critic, Bob Mondello, he's about five feet away, sitting right across from me in the studio. Today, he's 5,000 miles away at the BBC studios in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Bob, what's got you so worked up that you had to interrupt your vacation to tell me about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I just say that's no fair. So what was it called down there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The very word thriller suggests movement, action, heightened pulse. So how do you create that kind of momentum on the page?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who came to you first, Eddie or Aurelia or someone else?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why this period of history? You mentioned a certain interest or fascination with Richard Nixon. Was it that that drove you, or were you interested in placing a story in this period of time? Was it Nixon or Mona Visi or just a fascination with the '50s and '60s?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What role does racial tension play in the novels you write? If it's a color, an additional color in your palette as a novelist, is it a bright primary or a subtle pastel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you write dialogue?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you talk aloud when you do it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does political turmoil affect medical care?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've spent a couple of decades in Haiti. Have there been cycles of times when the health care system seemed to be improving a little bit, and then it would get worse again? DR. FARMER: That's exactly what's happened. It seems to me that you can make a fairly direct link between democratic governance and improved health care. The ministries of health and education function more efficiently. The public health system functions more efficiently. You know, we've gone through a number of different periods over the last 20-something years, family dictatorship, military regimes, elected governments, more coups. So, we've really seen it all. We've had a sampling of what it's like to try and provide good medical care in each of those times. When Haitian doctors are thinking about their own futures, and the country is unstable, what kind of decisions have they been making?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are non-governmental organizations, foreign organizations able to step in and replace all the doctors ad other health professionals who would leave in a situation like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has the Haitian government ever been very good at providing clean water for any percentage of the population, or basic sewage systems?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this donor nations who are concerned about whoever the latest government might be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you include the United States in that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are Haiti's problems, health problems, so serious now that any new government would have difficulty making a difference?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where does this Super Bowl fit in with the others in your mind?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is he at the right position?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How big a factor was Bettis in this game?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And perhaps you can begin describing how this works. Does it require, if I'm the air conditioner installer, must you have both an air conditioner installer and a transmission shop both in need of service?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But when you say that, is that a hypothetical, or do you actually have a plastic surgeon who has done breast implants?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " College tuition?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Mike Krane in Pittsburgh, where he is president of Green Apple Barter Service. By the way, do people barter green apples in the service?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. What would Fethullah Gulen do? Or more important, what would Fethullah Gulen say? Those must be significant questions, given the results of a poll that was organized by the British magazine Prospect and the American magazine Foreign Policy. They asked their readers to pick the world's top public intellectuals from among a list of 100 contenders, names like Noam Chomsky; Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa; Russian chess great Garry Kasparov, who challenged Vladimir Putin for the presidency of Russia; Al Gore. Well, forget about it. When the votes were in, it was the decline of the West. The top 10 finishers were all of Muslim background, and Tom Nuttall of Prospect Magazine joins us now to talk about public intellectual number one, Fethullah Gulen. Who is he?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yes. Is what you have experienced here the digital equivalent of stuffing the ballot box?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, is Prospect magazine - do you have many subscribers in Turkey at this point, or are you pushing to increase the number soon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So this wasn't just a one-time bombing. This was a full-blown assault?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are the Taliban doing something different now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Andrea Seabrook. This could be another bruising week for the nation's financial markets. The biggest bruisers, or maybe the bruised, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two companies' share prices took a dive last week because of worries about their financial condition, and there's nothing to suggest the turbulence is over. NPR's Jim Zarroli joins me now. Jim, last week was a nightmare for these companies and the people who own their stock, so what's going to happen tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is there a point when we'll know things have settled down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you mean by if the sale doesn't go well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's happening here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's going through your head?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The most surprising thing you saw in the prison?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what you're trying to do, then, is to give people who are being pursued under the Patriot Act by some agency of the government some sort of way of asking the question, does this really have to happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the House and Senate negotiators worked something out last December. It did not go far enough, the compromise they produced?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could the Congress just keep on voting these extensions if you can't reach some kind of agreement?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Senator Sinunu, on Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding hearings on President Bush's domestic surveillance program; in effect, warrantless wiretaps of Americans. Members of Congress as well as members of the general public have concerns that the government has overreached here. Do you think that that will affect efforts to re-up the Patriot Act?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hamas has already local offices in its control. Let's look at their track record. What kinds of services have they been able to provide for their constituents?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's look though at where they've fallen short in keeping their promises. What sort of things has Hamas not been able to deliver in office?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what were these companies created to do in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. One of the things that's always caused me trouble in understanding this is why there are two. How did Freddie Mac come about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've fast-forwarded here to the 1970s, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This isn't the first time they're run into trouble. In the '80s during the Savings and Loan crisis, there was trouble, wasn't there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so that's basically the model of what's happening today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, how do you make a seedless fruit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You just graft it over and over again or something?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And first of all, what does this news of the potential aid from the Fed for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, what does it mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And getting loans from the discount window, is that the same thing as a bailout?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is that why investors are selling off the shares, why Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been tumbling so low?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many stakeholders, shareholders, are we talking about here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And briefly, John, is it the case that the government backs these loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, it seems that the challenge for you is creating new legislation that is strict yet still constitutional. Where do you draw the line?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But how do you define self-defense in that case? And if someone is using the gun for self-defense, how quickly can they get to their firearm if the trigger lock is in place, if it's stored in a secure cabinet or safe of some kind?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do gun bans work? Because for years, when D.C. had this very strict gun ban, D.C. was known as the homicide capital of America?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm trying to get a hand on, Mr. Mendelson, on where you are in trying to draw the line in crafting this new legislation - if you are going to follow the directives, one that the court has given the district, or whether you're going to try to push back a little?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I'm just curious. Have you been skulking around grocery store aisles looking for examples of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what are they - what are you hearing from the provinces?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you give me a few examples?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, these changes sound slight. I mean, if you weren't looking out for this, would it be evident that the Country Crock tub is smaller than it used to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do the manufacturers ever alert customers, or at least, you know, provide some information in the fine print that they're doing this? Does Wrigley, for instance, note somewhere on the label that the 17-stick plenty pack is now a 15-stick?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is NPR, National Public Radio. In these uncertain financial times, many Americans are getting help from an old friend, the coupon. But this isn't just your old-fashioned 50 cent clipping that we're talking about. Today's coupons live as much on the Web as they do in the Sunday paper. In the advent of online social-networking sites, it's allowed fellow savers to pull their resources, share tips, and spread the word about hot deals, sometimes even before they hit the shelves. For more on the old coupon's new high-tech lease on life, I'm joined by Omar Gallaga. He covers technology culture for the Austin American-Statesman, and he recently immersed himself in the online coupon subculture. And Omar, what did you find?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " People blog about coupons?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The person who actually filled up a grocery cart and paid only $14 for that haul, were they bragging on some kind of blog? Is that how you found them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do the manufacturers think about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And we're not just talking about groceries, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For someone who is uninitiated, what's a good place to start?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it provide the coupons, or do you have to go and hunt the coupons down yourself?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Omar Gallaga, he covers technology culture for the Austin American-Statesman. The movers and shakers of the film world have gathered in Park City, Utah for the annual extravaganza that is the Sundance Film Festival. And as we do every year, we've got Kenneth Turan on the line. He is, of course, film reviewer for Morning Edition and the Los Angeles Times. So, there's always the buzz and the marketing surrounding this particular film festival, and what about this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's talk, then, about the films, and starting with the dramatic films, what did you find to be the most promising?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how about the documentaries? In the past, you've said that that category is consistently the best at the festival?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which was?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It gets one wondering, though, what is happening in the film world, that documentaries are often stronger than the dramas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, finally, Ken, the award ceremony is tomorrow night, big night, what are your predictions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Pretty nice, but nice enough to sell for a million dollars?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A victory by Hamas. How big of a deal is that and what kind of news is that for Israel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, that opportunity; let's get to that. From the Israeli point of view, what do you think the Israeli government's likely response will be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Hamas has largely respected a ceasefire for nearly a year. Can you see a circumstance in which they would indeed would become a partner in the process?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Give us an example. What's in this restructuring plan? And Ford did restructure just four years ago. What's in this plan that would do what just what you're saying, unclog the artery?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was there anybody trying to think differently?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much faster will your turnaround be in this new Ford, this new company, if you do spot a trend that's dramatically changing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is Ford trying to eliminate this provision when you renegotiate next year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Although, I think it's a fair question to ask if you don't try and renegotiate that, why wouldn't you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much would you place blame for Ford's problems on the workforce. If you're trying to sort of balance out all of the areas of concern with contracts that force you to pay health benefits and generous pensions to work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm actually not thinking of blame. I'm just trying to say if you're just evaluating it reasonably objectively?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, then what have you learned from complaints that Ford isn't building cars that people want to buy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With the recent cutbacks and the idling of plants, Ford has gotten smaller. Is it willing to become a smaller company with a smaller market share into the future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does this mean that European governments have not confirmed these allegations that they were hosting secret prisons?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's what he means by outsourcing torture, he's talking about this practice that we call rendition?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Watson, this story has been around for several months, now. How big is the news in Europe of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Although, as Disney buys the company, as you've mentioned, Steve Jobs then becomes a significant figure at Disney. What would he do there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What caused Steve Jobs' conflicts with Disney when these two companies worked together in the past?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Beyond the personalities, will this really change the way that either company is run, or what we end up seeing on movie screens?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jim Wallis, have you endorsed a candidate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But one of your criticisms of President Bush's office of faith-based initiatives was that it ended up supporting organizations that mostly agreed with him politically. Why would you expect a President Obama's office of faith-based programs to do any different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've talked a lot about Barack Obama in this conversation, let's talk about the Republicans right now. So have you gotten any indication from John McCain or his campaign that he will pursue partnerships with religious institutions as well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Conservative Evangelical leaders met in Denver last week to try to rally around the candidacy of John McCain. The group sent him a letter urging him to choose Mike Huckabee, himself a Southern Baptist minister - to choose him as McCain's running mate. Would you happy to see a minister in the vice president's office?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So this sounds just totally crazy. All those records being broken in one meet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I've heard a lot about this new super swimsuit; the Speedo LZR Racer. How much of a difference is it making?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the big name in swimming right now is Michael Phelps. Now, this guy is so fast and so versatile that he's qualified for eight different Olympic events. That means he's got a shot at topping Mark Spitz who took home seven gold medals in 1972?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And then there's another great amazing story from this meet; Dara Torres, you have a connection with her?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that mean there's hope for me; a 34-year-old mother to be an Olympic swimmer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so Jon, going forward now, does Nadal seem to have the edge just in the next 30 seconds?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what kind of car are you going to be buried in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ben Sollee, how do you write a pop song for the cello?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I mean, to me I can imagine some guy with a guitar kind of picking around in his basement or in his room working on a song. But when you have the cello, how do you imagine all the pieces coming together of a pop song?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How far back do flag pins go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a moment when you can see the flag pin, the lapel pin, becoming a little more partisan symbol than that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And perhaps you could begin with a definition. What is net worth and average net worth?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How, according to the Federal Reserve, how are we doing in terms of average net worth?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think it does to people to have that sense that between the stocks in their portfolio or their retirement account going down, the house price going down, and even the value of the car usually goes down, but if it's an undesirable big car now, it might be going down faster; what does that do to people's economic behavior?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When was it a good time in terms of increasing average net worth in the country? What were the glory days of increased net wealth?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That average of $192,000 that we achieved at the end of 2007, that would have been a pretty hefty increase over, say, 2001 or 2002?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And now it went down at the beginning of 2008. The expectation is, given what's happened on the stock market, in the stock market this year and real estate markets, housing markets, we'd assume it's going to keep going down, no?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were part of the American team of intelligence and military personnel trying to track down Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures, at the end of 2001, in the mountains of Southern Afghanistan. And, can you place us in one spot where you know Osama Bin Laden was for sure?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, let's be frank, when you're talking about getting warlords to switch sides in Afghanistan, we're talking about large stacks of hundred dollar bills here right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Truckloads?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I mean you started with $11 million, how many dollars did you have at the end of a number of weeks of fighting?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how bad is the situation in Nigeria?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thank you very much. Nick Fielding is a journalist and author speaking from London. We don't know much yet about a helicopter that has crashed in Iraq, but here's what we do know so far. The chopper crashed today just north of Baghdad. Two people were killed. And we're told this is the third downing of a chopper in the past 10 days. Cause of the crash is under investigation. There are unconfirmed eyewitness reports of missiles being fired at that chopper. Now as the violence in Iraq continues, so does the political dealing, though politicians are not entirely sure yet where they stand with voters. NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro joins us on the line from Baghdad. And, Lourdes, it's been more than a month now since Iraq's election, but the final results are not in. Why not? LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO reporting: The main thing is--that's delayed the results coming out are the charges by secularists and Sunni Arab groups that there was massive electoral fraud in Baghdad and in the South of Iraq. An international monitoring group is here right now; they're looking comprehensively into the allegations. They are expected to distribute their findings on Thursday. So everything has pretty much been on hold until those allegations are addressed. Now the Sunni groups are alleging that the main Shiite list used coercion, ballot stuffing and other undemocratic tactics, as they call it, to boost their votes. We did hear reports, for example, on the day from foreign journalists in Basra that the police were using loudspeakers to urge voters to cast their ballot in support of the United Iraqi Alliance, the main Shiite list. So until this is resolved, most of the politicking has been low key. Well, now let me ask about this because this was an effort to get Sunni Arabs involved in the political process and to make them feel that they had a legitimate voice even if they didn't win the elections. Did these allegations of fraud undermine that effort?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So based on what you do know, who are the winners and losers here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can I just ask--if you have a consensus government, that would require, it would seem, that different people would more or less agree on something. Do Shiite leaders, Sunni Arab leaders and Kurdish leaders see themselves with enough in common that they could govern by consensus?"}

From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Andrea Seabrook. The U.S. military now admits it made big mistakes in Iraq. Tomorrow, the army will release a 700-page report documenting the lack of planning and preparation for the period after the initial invasion of 2003. The report is based on hundreds of interviews including accounts from active and recently retired officers. One of those is retired Army General Ricardo Sanchez. He was put in charge of ground forces in Iraq a few weeks after the fall of Baghdad. I spoke with Sanchez today from his home in San Antonio. One of the things that makes it so interesting, General Sanchez, is that in the past the Pentagon has rebutted suggestions that the post-war planning in Iraq was flawed. Now, the army in its own report says that it in fact was flawed. Is this as close as the military gets to admitting big mistakes in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What exactly does that mean, embrace those lessons? What does it mean practically?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " General Sanchez, the report has not come out yet. We haven't seen the full text of it. We only have hints and teases. But can you tell me, sir, at least in your opinion whether a large part of the mistakes made in Iraq are due to political failures from the civilian leadership?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you believe that these big mistakes that the Pentagon is now admitting could possibly have hampered irrevocably the course of the Iraq War?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's no doubt that the report will be used by both sides of the political campaigns going on right now. What do you think, General Sanchez, the argument that with so many mistakes that were made, that U.S. forces should just pull out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " General Sanchez, it is so easy to talk about, for both of us to talk about the civilian mistakes, the military mistakes, and so on, but we have to remember that there were so many U.S. military lives lost during this period that the army is admitting mistakes were made in. How do you read this report if you're a parent or wife or a husband of someone who was lost during this time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were the top ground commander in Iraq at the time of this report, do you believe you're responsible for any of these mistakes?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I know there have been a handful of states that have imposed moratoriums on the death penalty - Illinois, Maryland. These are for different cases though, aren't there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In places that you mentioned where there is no method of execution, can convicts still be sentenced to death?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...some way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell in the numbers showing the decline of the death penalty how much has to do with the states working out these problems. Can you tell that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you see this attitude change showing up in opinion polls?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Good. So, have you been watching?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, where are you from in Germany?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Cologne. And what is it like there during one of these games?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what are you going to be doing tomorrow during the game?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How far is Boston?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh, what you'll do for that atmosphere, huh?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " children who are born blind, they will cover their eyes when they hear things they don't like. So, that's how hardwired that is in us. So, as a body language expert, Joe Navarro, are you constantly aware of your own body language?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you fake it, though? I mean, if you know these signals that way couldn't you manipulate them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These behaviors that you describe, are they universal? Do unconscious gestures mean the same thing in every culture?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What would a surgeon want with this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just to explain the basics, ordinarily you would have to be at the National Figure Skating Championships and do very well in order to make the Olympic team, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that because it's just a more subjective sport, and so there's more room to slip in somebody who was injured during the time of the championships?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's talk about the people who are not injured and who have been able to compete. Who's in the lead in the women's event?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I do have to ask you if Michelle Kwan does get named, as you expect, that means that somebody else who has a great championship here is not going to go. Is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's start with those seals that Iran is removing. What exactly does that mean? How serious is that, removing seals?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Break it down for us. What is the technology that the Iranians are gaining, or would be gaining?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How long or how soon could that happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If, indeed, the world community has decided that this can only be about getting a nuclear weapon, is this the time to refer Iran to the UN Security Council?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " David Albright is a former UN inspector. He's president of the Institute for Science and International Security. Disgraced South Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk today apologized for publishing two fraudulent papers on embryonic stem research, but he repeated earlier claims that he had been deceived by junior scientists. In an emotional news conference in Seoul, he accepted full responsibility and asked the people of South Korea for forgiveness. Reporter Jon Herskovitz was at the news conference. He joins me now. Hello. JON HERSKOVITZ reporting: Hi. Good morning. Did Hwang offer any further explanation for the fabricated data?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was his explanation why they would have conspired against him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a possibility of criminal prosecution? Did he break any laws there in South Korea?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, as this has, you know, sort of shaken down, is there any part of his research on human cloning that was legitimate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So for this scientist that we've suddenly come to know based on this work and then this scandal, is his career over? What happens to him now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are a lot of ways to measure how well the US economy is doing. What do the latest numbers suggest to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And despite all that, polls show that the public isn't giving the president very high marks for his management of the economy. How come?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, you know, the White House doesn't control the economy as much as the public might think, but what could the president do, or the new Fed chairman, who could have a big impact on the economy? What could they do about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you see as the biggest risks right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Housing bubble, David?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So when you talk about risks, what else?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A reasonable expectation of privacy. Is that because he did not consent to his employer looking at those messages?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now I know that there are people listening to this conversation who use their e-mail at the workplace from time to time to send out a personal message, and they're wondering, is my personal e-mail actually personal if I'm using an employer's computer? What's the answer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the employer have to let you know that they plan on intermittently reviewing your e-mails?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What if you're at work and you check one of your private e-mail accounts on AOL or Gmail or something like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it make a difference if the mail is sent from a personal computer using a company's Web-based account?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now is there a difference if the company has issued you a Blackberry which has Web access or if you're using a cell phone and you're using text messages?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We hear of the blowing up of the cooling tower of the nuclear reaction at Yongbyon. It sounds very dramatic. How important is it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the North Korean record for proliferation? We know the story of the allegations, at least, that the building that the Israelis struck in a raid in Syria was a North-Korean-built reactor of some sort. Are they expected to, or are they obliged to disclose exactly whom they've shared technology with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the way this process works, if one can characterize it, can the U.S. or other parties to it add demands of the North Koreans or add requests, at least, of them like that one, without the North Koreans walking away from the table?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Right. You said when all of this - you talked about this end of this process, or alluded to it. Let's say that everything goes reasonably well in this, what's the end? How far away are we from the point at which North Korea is a non-nuclear state in the community of nations and there are no sanctions against them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well now, that three-percent drop in the Dow, was the sell-off in the stock market very broad-based? Did the other industries go down that much?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, but if the market isn't responding to the Fed, that would be presumably a jump up if they responded to the Fed, what are the reasons for this decline?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jim, are there any signs that the economy might be beginning to turn around, and this could be the bottom of the problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does Senator Obama foresee a residual long-term U.S. military presence in Iraq comparable to U.S. bases, say, in Germany or South Korea?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How then would Senator Obama express the regional interest? Would it be through naval presence, or would there be troops on the ground in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is what you're describing, when you include all of those missions together - our presence, the numbers in the thousands, in the tens of thousands? How large a remaining presence do you think might be in Iraq, say, at the end of an Obama presidency?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want you to talk about the nation next door, Iran. Senator Obama has, of course, been criticized for his offer to meet with Iranian President Ahmadinejad. He's been criticized for being naive. Is it naive to think that Iranian leadership could negotiate its role in Iraq and elsewhere in the region and its nuclear ambitions through some conventional bilateral diplomacy, or is Iran simply at the moment not led by people with whom such diplomacy could be productive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you say to Europeans, though, who had criticized and say that if you hold out the promise of a total change of U.S. posture toward Iran, that could undermine whatever multi-lateral progress has been made so far through the threat of sanctions, say, over Iran's nuclear ambitions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Senator McCain says it would be wrong for U.S. troops to leave Iraq before al-Qaida is defeated and before Iraqi security forces are effective. What are the measures of those goals? No more suicide bombings or IEDs? No more need even for U.S. air support for Iraqi security forces?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But then what constitutes the defeat of al-Qaida? I mean, there was a small Greek terrorist cell that operated for 20 years with three people committing a crime every year. What would be defeating al-Qaida?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are they then defeated now? Have they been defeated?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Should U.S. support continue for five years, 10 years if need be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If the surge in troop levels has been as successful as Senator McCain says, why talk about reducing troops at all? Why not send in another 30,000 troops or another 50,000 troops to get the job done that much faster?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But Senator McCain has made the point that violence has gone down precisely because there have been more troops. There were numbers of troops talked about in 2002 which were much larger than this still. Is it a limitation that you just can't send in anymore troops to Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Democrats endlessly repeat Senator McCain speaking of U.S. troops in Iraq for 100 years. Does Senator McCain foresee long-term U.S. bases on Iraqi soil?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Before I let you go, if you could put in a nutshell John McCain's view of foreign and security policy and how it would be distinguished from Senator Obama or even from President Bush, for that matter, what is it? How do you describe John McCain and his view of the world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you feel the sting when you fill up at the gas pump, imagine if you had to fill an entire fleet of school buses. The rising price of fuel has school districts around the country scrambling to cut transportation costs. Some districts are scrapping school-bus field trips, using mapping software to squeeze every drop out of the fuel tank or asking drivers to cut back on engine idling. In Montgomery County, Maryland, outside Washington, D.C., the school board this week decided that it might do away with bus service for students living a certain distance from school. More students would have to get to school on their own, by foot, by bike or by catching a ride with their parents. Sharon Cox is a Montgomery County school board member, and she's chair of the policy committee. She joins me now. Ms. Cox, why has it come to this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How might that change?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " At all age levels, for elementary-school students through high school?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The superintendent in Montgomery County said this proposal sends, quote, \"a very strong message.\" Is that, in part, what this is really all about, sending a message to taxpayers who might be willing to swallow a tax hike or to unions that might consider a trim in their salaries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it's symbolic?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I just want to take apart some of the things that you mentioned. This short-term tax relief, will it really make a difference?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you mentioned that your dad was a truck driver. As I understand, your brother also spent years working in an oil refinery. You know, the discussion of oil policy that takes place in the marbled halls of the Capitol is quite different from the discussion that takes place at the dinner table. When people sit down and talk about these issues, do their concerns about oil policy at all reflect what we're hearing from John McCain right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Governor, I want to turn from energy to politics, if I can. Minnesota, as you well know, was an important swing state in the last election. It's expected to be one again in the upcoming general election this fall. But many, even within your own party, say the GOP brand has taken a bit of a beating, particularly in the last two years. How damaged is the brand?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First question: How much oil is offshore?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If an oil company started work today, if it had permission, it went out, it started looking for the oil, how long would it be before it could be pumping it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Given what the oil companies think is out there, how does it compare with our needs and with the world's energy needs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You measured the president's estimate of offshore production as a percent less than one percent of world demand. What about Americans who say how about American demands? Is there a discrete, national domestic economy of petroleum here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK. I've been wondering this myself. Who exactly are financial planners and how do you go about finding a good one?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, now let's talk about this a little bit. Let's try to figure out a strategy for those of us who are fairly competent to manage our own money or to evaluate the qualifications of a financial planner. What do I look for if I'm interviewing someone, in effect, and trying to listen to their initial take to see if I want to take their advice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, isn't that going to be a major problem because a lot of these people who offer financial planning services are connected to some stockbroker firm or some other kind of firm that is in the business of selling people like me other kinds of investment tools as the same time they're offering advice on what to buy and sell?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jonathan, could most of us get by without a financial planner at all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can I get you to explain your best understanding of the nuts and bolts of what the National Security Agency has been doing? Who's calling from where, who's listening and how are they doing that, as best you've been able to determine?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " General Michael Hayden, who was the head of the National Security Agency when this program began and is still a very senior intelligence official, has told reporters that there is always one party to a conversation who is identified as being al-Qaeda or linked to al-Qaeda. Do you believe that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the eavesdropping in your mind fit a broader pattern of the way that the Bush administration has pursued the war on terror?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did White House officials in the Bush administration send signals to the CIA about the kind of intelligence they wanted to get?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...the idea of an invasion of Iraq. What were the steps that were taken?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, given the skepticism within the CIA in particular toward this war, who was it that ultimately pushed the agency to provide the intelligence to back up the assertions that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and to generally support the program? Was it Vice President Cheney? Was it President Bush? Was it George Tenet, who was the director at the time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " George W. Bush and his father have been seen as two very different presidents. What have you found out about the relationship between those two men?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We do not want to write the obituary of this man who is still on life support, but can you describe the place that Ariel Sharon has held in Israeli politics for decades?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now in more recent months, particularly, he's become the founder of a new political party in Israel that was seen as a centrist party trying to battle against more extreme voices on both sides. What do you think happens to that party now that Sharon is in the condition that he's in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...that made him so widely respected at this point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's start with Palestinian elections, and those elections are scheduled for January 25th. Right at the moment, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas is threatening to delay them. What is going on here and why is this election so important?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, just, though, to speak about the Brotherhood and its agenda, is it about political reform or is it about political reform leading to a greater role for Muslim law in Egypt?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk finally about the evolution of democracy in Lebanon. What is the situation there now that Syria has withdrawn its troops and at least left technically?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you were in this very studio two summers ago talking about the launch of Independence Air. What happened? Why did it fail?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And will other airlines honor Independence Air tickets? You know, what about refunds, frequent-flier miles, everything that the consumer wants to know?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the employees of Independence Air? Will they be picked up by other airlines?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the question, of course, when any airline goes out of business and sometimes even into bankruptcy, but in this case, out of business is: What does this do to the industry?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now just to make it clear, that would mean Saudi Arabia would raise its output to the highest level in decades, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about other oil producing countries? Are they planning to follow Saudi Arabia's cue here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Caryle Murphy, the U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman is at the meeting and his position is that the price of oil is high because production is too low. So how is that argument being received there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what practically, besides Saudi Arabia's announcement to increase production has been decided at this meeting in Jeddah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now there's an interesting storyline this year as well with Serbia. Serbia is a country that we don't often sort of identify with tennis. There's no serious tradition of tennis in the country, yet two of the top three seated women are Serbs; Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic. How does that match-up look?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is there a good chance that Ana Ivanovic, the number one seat could actually win?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John, there's of course still two weeks to go before the championship is decided, but who's a sleeper? Who's a player we short of be on the lookout for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But you've written a book in which the conceit is that they are all related. So how did this idea come about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in the book, the outlaws Frank and Jesse James essentially kidnap the novelist Henry James from the train and Henry manages to send a letter out to his brother William James at Harvard explaining what happened. Can you read that for us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in the story, how did Henry James perform as a bank robber?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I mean do you sort of get a kick out of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I sometimes found myself sort of thumbing through a history book and going back to the novel trying to figure out what actually happened. And a lot of it is historically accurate. How did you do the research for the book? What did you have to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Liebmann-Smith, do you suppose that one day an unsuspecting college student might stumble upon the book without knowing that it's a parody and then you could - some sort of read about the brothers Henry and Jesse James on Wikipedia or something?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Richard Liebmann-Smith is the author of \"The James Boys: A Novel Account of Four Desperate Brothers.\" It's published by Random House. Israel apparently launched a major military exercise over the Mediterranean earlier this month that included more than 100 war planes. The story was first reported in the New York Times this week. U.S. officials believe the exercise was a dry run for a possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. But more immediately, perhaps, a message to the world and for internal Israeli political purposes. Joining us now is Amir Oren. He is the chief national security correspondent for the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz. Mr. Oren, what's the Israeli government saying about these maneuvers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Oren, here in the United States polls show that most Americans would oppose military action against Iran. If I understand you correctly, in Israel there is a broader consensus and support for a possible attack on Iran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, I take it when Israel's former chief of the army Shaul Mofaz recently told an Israeli newspaper that an attack on Iran is unavoidable, that didn't make people uncomfortable in Israel? That didn't irritate the government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And practically speaking here, is the Israeli government prepared for the kind of retaliation that Iran might launched in the event its nuclear facilities were attacked?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think at some level some Israeli officials are happy that the information of this military exercise leaked out, that in a sense they kind of want the world to know about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, first of all, this city of Dallas must own hundreds of cars. So, what does four-and-a-half dollars a gallon for gas mean for your budget?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, as you say, a 20 percent increase in cost of fuel. What kind of relief can you look for? I mean, do you look to the state? Do you look to the federal government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you heard any ideas from other mayors at the conference that you might want to steal and take back with you to Dallas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, I mean, has the cost of gas really sort of accelerated this process of making changes in big cities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you mean by that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Professor Saunders, according to recent data by the U.S. Geological Survey, China not only makes about half of all the cement of the world but it doesn't really export it either. In other words, it's using almost all of the cement that it makes, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to sort of visualize what that would look like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there any countries that come even close to what China is making?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, of course, when we talk about the world's biggest polluter, China is producing more carbon dioxide than any other country, but per capita the United States is still the world's biggest producer of carbon dioxide. But if China is industrializing so quickly and producing so much cement, I mean, is there any sort of hope that China's emissions will be reduced any time soon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, listen to some of that sound that would be emitted from these speakers. This is a recording, I think, of the hybrid accelerating. Now, that to me sounds like George Jetson's car or like a ride in Disneyland. But that's the sound of a hybrid accelerating? I mean, this is an invented sound that you guys made, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I've got to say I'm pretty sure we're going to get emails from listeners saying, you know, there's already plenty of noise out there. I mean, aren't you guys just sort of adding to the noise pollution? I mean, shouldn't be hybrid drivers just be more careful and, you know, watch out for pedestrians?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, I mean, are we going to be hearing, like, the Macarena coming out of cars?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, tell me, how can a sniff of hydrogen sulfide actually save human life? How does that work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what kind of injuries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, how does it react with the human body? I mean, what does it actually do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " sulfide inhaler?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And just to be clear, you've been studying animals. This hasn't been tested on humans yet. Is there any timeline for when we might see hydrogen sulfide being used in the field?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Justice Department has just concluded the latest phase in an enormous crackdown on mortgage fraud. The sweep was named Operation Malicious Mortgage. The FBI arrested more than 400 real estate agents, brokers, appraisers and developers in the past three months alone. The message is clear: the penalty phase of this mortgage crisis has officially begun. NPR's FBI correspondent Dina Temple-Raston has been reporting the story. She joins me now. Dina, now we saw this week the Bear Sterns' hedge fund managers arrested in New York and then the announcement of this wider sweep. What kind of people are the FBI targeting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So every part of the real estate food chain. What were these people accused - or what are they accused of doing? What kind of scams are they accused of running?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So even with the downturn in the market, it sounds like there are still opportunities for scam artists and fraud?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And just quickly, Dina, before we let you go, is this a national campaign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Edith Macefield just wanted to die in the house where her mother had died, on the couch where her mother had died. And on Father's Day, she did. No word on what's next for the little house she left behind. From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris. At the high school in Gloucester, Massachusetts, at least 17 teenage girls are pregnant. That more than quadruples the school's pregnancy rate over last year. But what stuns people in this largely Catholic town is that it seems that these teenagers were trying to get pregnant. Kathleen Kingsbury is a reporter for Time magazine. She helped bring national attention to the story with her recent story that she published in Time, and she joins us now. Kathleen, what do we know about these girls? For instance, how old are they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it's been reported that these girls actually wanted to get pregnant, that they made not necessarily individual decisions, but they decided as a group. What do you know about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any idea why they would make that decision?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you had a chance to talk to any of these young women?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...but really just to raise the curiosity here. How would that improve their situation? How would that make things better?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the school - does it follow abstinence only sex education policy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the story on the spike in teenage pregnancies in Gloucester was focused primarily on the young girls. What about the fathers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...what's the community reaction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you've been living off your savings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the profits that you make from the convenience store, are you able to hold on to those? Or are there any profits?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Exxon Mobile last week said that it plans to sell or close all of its gas stations. Did it surprise you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You think it's possible there will be no, no definitive answer here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's explain the tomato forensics here. Once you know that you have an outbreak of the same strain of salmonella, how do you begin running it back and where does that take you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the web is widening with every step that you're taking?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There has been, as you know, criticism from Congress and from consumer groups that say the FDA has been dragging its feet on developing a food protection plan and now we see nearly 300 people at least sickened with this salmonella outbreak. How do you respond to those criticisms? Is the FDA moving too slowly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...assume it's safe, go ahead buy it, go ahead and eat it? Or wait a little longer, until you figure out what the source of the outbreak was?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " David Acheson is the associate commissioner for foods with the Food and Drug Administration. Pakistan's president, Pervaiz Musharraf, has ordered religious schools to expel all foreign students by tomorrow. This is an effort to cut back on religious extremism. The order was issued in July, following the terrorist bombings in London. This week, however, the governing body of Pakistan's madrassas said it will resist. We called the BBC's Zaffar Abbas in Islamabad to learn more about the situation. And first off, can you describe for us the role that madrassas play in Pakistani life? They're pretty numerous and pretty influential, aren't they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why are foreign students of special concern to Pakistani authorities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well--so the president has made that statement. The madrassas have said they will resist this order. Does the government of Pakistan actually have the power to track down numerous foreign students and take them away?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned political will here, the political aspect of this. Is it possible that Pakistani authorities could quietly let this order slip away in some cases?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wouldn't there be an argument for putting an end to what someone thought of as a terrible government in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's talk about the situation now. The United States is now in Iraq. There have been some calls to withdraw. The president has said it's necessary to stay. What are the questions that we should consider as we decide what's right and what's wrong?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can a good outcome, a good ending justify what you see as an unjust war?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it always necessary to wait to be attacked before you send your military in to a country where you perceive a threat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you take that same walk along the coastline now in Sri Lanka, what do you see?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you spoke to us a year ago, you also mentioned that people were having to bury their dead in mass graves. They considered that a public health measure. Of course, many people were distressed to have to take that step. What have people done since, when it comes to mourning those that they lost?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the federal commitment of billions of dollars for levee restoration do anything so far for restoring wetlands outside of New Orleans?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can a city die while people are waiting on decisions about that city's future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Patt Morrison, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times. You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Today, John McCain headed to the heart of the nation's oil and gas industry. He spoke in Houston this afternoon, where he outlined his views on energy. He called for more offshore oil drilling and later tonight, he'll do some prospecting of his own: He'll attend a pair of fundraisers. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now from Houston. And Scott, we just heard Barack Obama talking in Detroit about reinventing the auto industry. What was John McCain's message there in oil country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These ideas, of course, come at a time when drivers are angry about gasoline that's $4 a gallon and headed higher. Would these ideas help?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Scott, John McCain has been trying to appeal to environmentalists in this campaign with some ideas on climate change, for example. Was there anything for them today in his speech in Houston?"}

And Dave Givens, how long is your commute?"}

South Korean trade officials are in Washington this week. They're hoping to reach a compromise that will calm fears back at home. NPR's Anthony Kuhn joins us now from Seoul.

Today, Turkey's constitutional court overturned a law that had allowed woman students to wear headscarves, and let me ask you: If that's an omen of what's to come in the other lawsuit, is the AK Party in danger of being shut down and its leaders banned from politics?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, now on to some other issues between the U.S. and Sudan not involving Darfur: the U.S. envoy yesterday suspended talks on normalizing relations with the Sudanese government. And that I gather relates to the threat that the three-year-old peace deal between Sudan's north and south could be breaking down. What are you hearing about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the fact that these tribal leaders are willing to participate in the elections mean that they have bought into the Iraqi political process?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These Sunni Muslims ended up introducing you to an insurgent leader. What were the circumstances in which that happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's been suggested by US officials that just the process of going through elections will weaken the insurgency because it would add legitimacy to the Iraqi government and perhaps encourage people to come into the political process and vote rather than being outside the political process and setting bombs. Do you think the insurgent that you met sees the choices in that way?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lebanon hasn't had a president since November. Why did this take so long?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of the first things that the new president, General Suleiman, did today was he said he would strengthen ties with Syria. But as you just mentioned, the controversy over that relationship between Lebanon and Syria has been one of the main reasons for the political turmoil in Lebanon. How significant was that announcement today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can General Michel Suleiman, the new president of Lebanon now, can he really bring the country together?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But haven't all the leaders of Lebanon essentially been saying the same thing for months about Hezbollah, that Hezbollah has to disarm?"}

They hope to finally clear the logjam that's kept most foreign aid and workers out of the country since a cyclone ravaged Myanmar three weeks ago. More than 100,000 people are dead or missing, and the government said today it needs $11 billion to rebuild. NPR's Michael Sullivan spent more than a week in Myanmar after the storm. He's on the line now from Bangkok, Thailand. Michael, have they cleared the logjam? Is the aid now going to get through?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Michael, 100,000 dead or missing in Myanmar, as many as 5 million people homeless. I mean, clearly that aid is desperately needed, and the world is clamoring to help. Why the resistance from the government in Myanmar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Michael, what are you hearing from the Irrawaddy Delta from either aid workers or folks down there where the cyclone hit the hardest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Michael, as we mentioned earlier, the government is asking for $11 billion in aid from the international community to rebuild, but they want to control access into Myanmar. With those kinds of demands, will they get that kind of money?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Michael, you've covered disasters around the world for more than a decade. Have you ever seen a situation like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Mr. Brookhiser, you called George Washington America's founding CEO. What do you mean by that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, is it possible, Richard Brookhiser, to fall into the trap of sort of venerating George Washington's leadership simply because he lived a long time ago? I mean, this was long before 24-hour news and the Internet. Were there decisions he made that can be considered failures?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, oddly enough, George Washington was not a great communicator. I understand he only spoke three times at the constitutional convention. That's over a four-month period. But don't you have to be a good communicator to be a successful leader?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What gave you the urge to pick up a pen and write poetry about what you were feeling?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " In this first story the narrator is a Vietnamese-born author from Australia. He was studying at the famed Iowa Writers Workshop. His name is Nam Le, and yet you've written a work of fiction. Why did you choose to start the book with this story?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, we'll never really know if it's you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This character is very much at war in a sense with his ethnicity, or at least writing about his Vietnamese Australian heritage. Is that something you struggle with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, Nam Le, not all the stories in the book are about you or an alter ego. In fact, the first story is the only one. One of my favorites is called \"Tehran Calling.\" Can you tell us a little bit about that story?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you read a passage from that story for use?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Nam Le, what struck me about this story was how vivid the imagery of the city of Tehran appears. The Shiite (unintelligible) procession with a self- flagellation. The rutted roads you talk about, the stale fluorescent lighting of the airport. Have you ever been to Tehran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you write so convincingly about these places that you've never been to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How important is it to make it really authentic?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you ever worry about somebody saying, well, you know, you're a fraud. You've never been to these places; you're just going online and doing this research. Do you ever worry about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You also write from the perspective in a sense of characters that you would otherwise be completely unfamiliar with, having grown up in Australia, how do you write these kinds of characters that you've never really met?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what makes this match up so great?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, both these teams, the Penguins and the Red Wings, were actually among the top performing teams during the regular season, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I want to ask you about Sidney Crosby. As you say, he's 20 years old - he's already being compared to Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and Gordie Howe. Is he that good?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, this series can save hockey in a sense?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If it works out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " All right. Damien Cox, go out on a limb for us: who's going to win it all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And let's talk about the conditions that are being created. The withdrawal of US troops depends on the success of Iraqi security forces to replace them. This week, both The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times are reporting that members of Iraqi security forces loyal to Shiite militias have been killing Sunnis. What do you know about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm sorry. Sir, are you saying the reports are false, that Shiite militias, people loyal to Shiite militias, have not killed Sunnis?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it still true that most Iraqi security forces are organized and divided along ethnic or sectarian lines?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Iraq's national security adviser says that it's only isolated incidents where Iraqi security forces have been targeting people from different sectarian groups. What did your reporting find?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do these killings make it harder to contemplate the moment when Iraqi security forces could be trusted to take over from American troops?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When such a president comes along, what are the strengths of that position?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " By comparison to what, a president and maybe one of the model presidents who responds to events?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would the brouhaha over Harriet Miers on the part of the social conservatives and the right fit into this pattern?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In Iraq, Thanksgiving Day was a violent one. More than 50 people were killed in attacks across the country. The worst incident occurred outside a hospital some 15 miles south of Baghdad. A suicide bomber steered his car at a group of US soldiers who were handing out candy and toys to children. Almost all of the dead were women and children. Washington Post reporter Ellen Knickmeyer joins me now from Baghdad. And what more can you tell us about this latest suicide attack in Iraq, this one involving the soldiers and the kids and the women who were with them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Iraqi and American officials have repeatedly warned of an increase in violence leading up to the parliamentary elections this December 15. What steps are being taken to try and contain the violence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now there is a report of possible peace negotiations between insurgent groups and the government in Baghdad. What do you know about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And then just finally the trial of Saddam Hussein is beginning again on Monday. What's the latest on that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, even given the terrible crime that was committed, is there a direct line of unbroken evidence leading to Saddam Hussein?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much does this issue of security affect the probability of getting a fair trial in this case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, that does get us, though, to an ongoing argument. Saddam's lawyers have questioned the court's legitimacy given that it was set up, basically, under American occupation. I mean, you helped set this up. What do you say when someone argues that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK, so now on to the business of saving Thanksgiving. Perhaps the most serious Thanksgiving nightmare, a turkey that is only partly thawed, and I put it in the fridge two days ago. The outside is fine, but deep in the belly of the bird lies a glacier. And guess what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Cover? Fill the sink up, right, enough to cover it up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That solved, here's another pie predicament. Bake a pumpkin pie and it develops cracks. There's a quick fix. You can hide it under whipped cream, but next time try taking the pie out of the oven before it's cooked all the way through. The middle should still be wobbly--I know, a little scary--but it will continue to cook while on the counter, and it will be both crack-free and richer tasting. Let's say you end up with dry pie, you're looking at it. It's Thanksgiving. Any way to fix that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's talk about the parts of this that make some lawmakers uncomfortable. Why is extending a capital gains tax cut something that would seem politically risky?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So where do things stand now? What actually did get through one part of Congress or another?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now people are talking about tax cuts at a time when there's a budget deficit. Given the dimensions of the deficit, why would they push for more tax cuts now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think a tax increase is inevitable?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, David Wessel, we're talking about adjustments to the tax code here. How does that compare to the much more ambitious goals that President Bush set some time ago to completely reform the tax code?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about John McCain? You said that the notion of balancing the ticket is pass\u00e9; would that apply to the Republicans as well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John McCain is holding an interesting event this weekend. A number of candidates and their spouses are going to be coming through and meeting with him. Have you ever seen anything like that before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how do you go about doing that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did you decide to go back to using the mugshots?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have there been any families that have stepped forward and said we don't want our kids' - our loved ones' picture in the paper?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And have you honored that request?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was the purpose of this? What were you hoping to accomplish?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The homicide rate has continued to increase since this map was introduced a few years ago. Was there a hope that something like this might help reduce those numbers, reverse those numbers in the city?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both campaigned in Florida today. A big question mark hangs over the Sunshine State. As you probably heard by now, Florida and Michigan were stripped of their delegates, a penalty imposed by the Democratic National Committee for holding their primary contests too early. Clinton won in both states but neither candidate campaigned in Florida and Obama was not on the ballot in Michigan. Getting those primaries to count is one final strategy for Hillary Clinton. Despite her big win in Kentucky yesterday, she still trails Obama in the delegate count. Today, Senator Clinton pressed again for the DNC to seat Florida's delegates. Barack Obama's primary win in Oregon yesterday gave him a majority of pledged delegates, and his visit to Florida is intended to underscore that state's importance in the general election. Earlier today, I spoke with David Axelrod, the chief strategist for the Obama campaign. I asked him, what would be an acceptable deal regarding those delegates from Florida and Michigan?"}

The fighting is taking place in a Euphrates River town in a region where there's been fighting for months. A US Marine was killed by small-arms fire in the second day of this offensive. US military officials say the operation, about 200 miles northwest of Baghdad, is intended to deprive al-Qaeda in Iraq of a key staging area for its attacks. NPR's Peter Kenyon is following the story from Baghdad. And Peter, are you able to tell, is this, in fact, a kind of stronghold that the US military says it is, for the enemy? PETER KENYON reporting: Well, so far the Marines are officially confirming 17 insurgent deaths. There are unconfirmed reports of many more. The military is reporting some resistance but also a lot of abandoned houses, presumably many abandoned by civilians trying to avoid the cross-fire, but some probably vacated by the insurgents. It seems as if the US and Iraqi forces will soon control this town, known as Husaybah, on the Euphrates River. The question is, will they be able to hold it and then expand their area of control to really deny the insurgents this pipeline into Iraq? So they believe they have found some insurgents there. Now this was the first large-scale deployment of the Iraqi army, at least in that part of the country. How are they doing?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. Iraq closed its borders and shut down Baghdad international airport today. These are some of the preparations for a nationwide referendum on a constitution which is coming on Saturday. In a moment, we'll talk to the commander of US forces in Iraq. We'll start our coverage with Borzou Daragahi. He's a Baghdad correspondent for the Los Angeles Times and he's on the line from Iraq. What are the streets like today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now insurgent leaders, some of them, have been saying that they will not interfere with this vote. What are they trying to do, as best you can determine?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So we have three major groups in Iraq. We have Shiite Muslims and Kurds who seem to be expected to approve this constitution. We have Sunnis who are divided. Some leaders have signed on this week, after some changes were made in the proposed constitution, but still there's a Sunni member of the government who predicts the constitution will fail. Why such pessimism at this moment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " General, al-Zawahiri in this letter also writes, `More than half this battle is taking place in a battlefield of media.' Do you agree with that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the United States continue to have a disadvantage of sorts when it comes to trying to win an argument or even have an argument before the Islamic world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're trying to influence people through the political process. It looks like the enemy is also now trying to influence people through the political process. And looking at this as a very, very long conflict, does that make your job harder?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, General, in some recent congressional testimony, you were talking about the desire to pull some American troops from Iraq when conditions permit and you said it's about dependency, meaning that you want the Iraqis not to be dependent in the end on US forces and allied forces. As you look forward over the next few years, are you prepared to let Iraqis run the risk of being defeated in order to take that step of making them stand on their own two feet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said in congressional testimony that in your estimation, the border between Iraq and Syria, the border region, is not under control at this time. What has made that region so important and also so difficult to control?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that you're killing insurgents faster than insurgents are being recruited at this time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I guess this is what I'm driving at. I know that the two things you're trying to do simultaneously is build up the Iraqi security forces so they're stronger and also reduce the threat to Iraq by battering down the insurgency. Is the insurgency weaker than it was a year ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Those comments could only come from cowboy, poet, philosopher, former large animal veterinarian and culinary critic Baxter Black. This is NPR News. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is in Central Asia trying to shore up US influence in a strategically vital part of the world. Today she arrived in Kyrgyzstan and visited a base that had been used by American forces for operations in nearby Afghanistan. NPR's Michele Kelemen is traveling with the secretary and she joins us now from Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek. And how important is it for the US to remain in bases in Central Asia, Michele? MICHELE KELEMEN reporting: Well, it's been very important for the continuing war in Afghanistan. You might remember that Uzbekistan is now telling the Americans to get out of a base there by the end of this year, so it's been very important to maintain the other bases that the US has been using in the region. Losing the Uzbek base is a big blow, but the military officials and State Department officials traveling with us say there are work-arounds, it's just getting to be more expensive. The one that's here in Kyrgyzstan, there are about a thousand US military personnel there. Secretary Rice stopped by and met with some of them today and gave them a bit of a pep talk. We're also going a little bit later on this trip to Tajikistan, and they've also allowed the US to use military bases there for resupply and logistics help for the war in Afghanistan. Now Rice says she doesn't want to make this the focus of her trip. She says military relations are pretty good with countries in the region and she wants to make this about democracy promotion. Although promoting democratic reform could be a bit of a task in that region. What are her expectations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the secretary is not far there from the region in Pakistan that was hit by that terrible earthquake. Is she planning to go there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are you going to do that's any different from what's always been done?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which countries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if they're willing to change their entire business across the country to keep unions out, how do you counter that?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " If there were some kind of an alliance between your labor unions and Republicans, what would it look like?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " The new government of Pakistan is negotiating a ceasefire agreement with Pushtun tribes whose lands border Afghanistan. This is the area where al-Qaida and the Taliban are strong and the talks are causing some consternation in Washington. The Pakistani government is lead by the party of the late Benazir Bhutto. One of the key people they are negotiating about is the man who the U.S. and the previous Pakistani government say was behind her assassination. For more on the agreement, we turn to NPR's Philip Reeves, who's in Islamabad, Pakistan. Philip, welcome. And first, who is negotiating with whom and how far have the negotiations gone?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And under the terms of the agreement, as it's been developed so far, what would each side do? What would the government do and what would the Mehsud tribe do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now is this the very kind of deal that - the U.S. and Benazir Bhutto herself faulted Pervez Musharraf for making, that is, conceding some control of the tribal areas to militant tribal leaders?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can we go back to one provision of this 15-point agreement? That is to say the Mehsud tribal leaders saying that - within, I gather, a rather short period time, they would get rid of foreign fighters in their area. How significant is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do these negotiations, involving the Pakistani government, does it suggest a different policy in Islamabad toward the United States and are there implications here for U.S.-Pakistani relations?"}

These numbers are coming from the Web site RealClearPolitics and that total does not include some caucuses in states that didn't release popular vote totals. When Israeli jets bombed the mysterious facility in the Syrian Desert last fall, not much was said about exactly what was being bombed. Well, according to reports on Capitol Hill tomorrow, the CIA will brief congressional committees and will tell them that the site housed a nuclear reactor that was being built with the help of North Korea. The briefing is expected to based largely an information passed on by the Israelis. Jay Solomon writes about this in today's Wall Street Journal and join his now. And Jay Solomon, first of all, do we know how solid the evidence is linking North Korea with this facility?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, there are two separate stories here, separate but related. One is, what would the North Koreans doing in Syria at this place that the Israelis bombed? And the other is how does this figure in U.S.-North Korean relations over North Koreas nuclear program in general? What's going on there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jay Solomon, I've heard from other reporters who are worked on this story from back in September when the Israelis struck the site in Syria. And they were struck by the extraordinary secrecy about this. How few people were saying anything about why the Israelis had attacked this Syrian target? Why the Syrians seem to make remarkably little of an attack on their soil? Do you understand it all the extraordinary lack of comment about this very unusual attack?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Jay Solomon, reporter with the Wall Street Journal. Today, the managing editor of the Wall Street Journal announced that he is stepping down just four months after Rupert Murdoch took over the paper. Murdoch also emerged as the top suitor for the tabloid Newsday, which serves Long Island and Queens. That would give Murdoch's News Corp control over a large chunk of the New York media. NPR's David Folkenflik joins us to help explain what's happening. And David, first of all, why is the Wall Street Journal managing editor, Marcus Brauchli, departing so quickly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if we are seeing more, say, political stories in the front page of the Journal, we're seeing evidence of Murdoch's push to make the Journal a more general-interest newspaper?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's driving the push - Murdoch's push to make the Journal a more general-interest paper as opposed to a business paper?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, where in that scheme would possibly purchasing Newsday fit in?"}

That's a new twist in the saga. Larry Franklin is a Pentagon analyst who was first charged in May. And he has pleaded not guilty up until now. The shift in strategy means Franklin is likely to become the government's star witness and that he will testify against the two remaining defendants in the case. NPR's intelligence correspondent Mary Louise Kelly has been following the story and she joins us now. So, Mary Louise, first, what's behind this latest twist? Why is Franklin changing his plea now?"}

One key official in the face of that storm is Lieutenant General Russel Honore. He commands military units responding to the storms along the Gulf Coast. General, we've been listening over the last few days as federal, state and local officials around New Orleans have been saying different things: Return to New Orleans, don't return to New Orleans; it's safe in some areas, it's not safe.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've talked about this before. Would the Fed be more likely to raise interest rates now to avoid any concern and worry as this transition takes place at the top of the Fed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you going to raise the ground level?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you talking about a smaller city then in terms of geographic area?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Should it still have half a million people in it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I know the message has been sent repeatedly, people are welcome back in New Orleans, even the poor are welcomed back in New Orleans, but I want to ask: Do you want all poor people to relocate to New Orleans or might it be a good thing in your view if poverty is spread out a little bit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is an utterly devastating flood, of course, but it is not the first major flood to strike Louisiana or even New Orleans for that matter. People have warned for years about this kind of problem. Solutions have been attempted. Millions, even billions, of dollars have been spent, and still you had the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. What gives you confidence, if anything, that the state and the country will get it right this time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Good. So, where are you? What does the dig look like right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Isn't it a little scary or maybe awe-inspiring to dig up ground at Stonehenge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's back up a second. The first pieces of Stonehenge, the actual rise and some of the first rocks were there 3,000 years before the common era, B.C.E. - and then you're talking about the bluestones arriving, I don't know, 1,200 years after that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do the bluestones mean, do you think, in your theory?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, how is your dig helping you support your theory?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How soon? When do you think we'll get some actual results from your findings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So in the first of yesterday's two Final Four games the outcome never seemed to be in doubt from the very beginning, the opening tip-off - Memphis manhandled UCLA. Were you surprised to see that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why hasn't Memphis - a team that's only lost one game this year - why hasn't it gotten the same publicity that other big teams did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How'd they do last night?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Stewart Mandel, you know about this stuff. What did your bracket look like at the beginning of March Madness?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The championship game is tomorrow night. What are your thoughts then - Memphis versus Kansas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And finally, to top off our sports segment tonight, the hard-hitting world of intercollegiate chess. The Final Four of Chess is at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County this weekend, and once again, there's a team that stomped Harvard, MIT, Stamford. Who is this amazing team? The Sharks from Miami Dade Community College. Call them the Cinderellas of chess. Rene Garcia is a psychology professor at the school and is the chess team advisor. He's at the final chess tournament in Baltimore. How are you, Mr. Garcia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Good. How does a community college in Miami end up with such an amazing chess team?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What year was that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I have to ask: does this have something to do with perhaps the Cuban education system?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, I imagine. So, you got lucky, huh?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Rene Garcia, how's your chess game?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you advise an all-star chess team?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what did happen to cities like Washington after the migration of blacks out into the suburbs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was this a nationwide trend?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do we still see the effects of this today as we look around?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does race figure into that, or does it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what happens now to those neighborhoods that are left with the abandoned buildings and vacant lots?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Last week we asked listeners to tell us about their best April Fools stories. Though we can never be entirely sure who's fooling whom, we did get a laugh out of these. Listener Liz Reba wrote to us that she once tried to register her cat with HR as a domestic partner. She notes that the rules at the time didn't actually require both parties to be human. And then there was the Ritter family. Son Andrew Ritter seemed to live for April Fools, and each year his parents would nervously wait for the results. One year there was nothing. The elder Ritters waited on edge. Chris Ritter wrote to us: all of the sudden at the end of the day we found a series of Polaroid snapshots of our kitchen covered in sand with beach mats, beach balls, people lying around sunning on the sand, etc. So we ran into the kitchen but there was absolutely nothing there. Chris Ritter and his wife got down on their hands and knees, not a single grain of sand to be found anywhere. Somehow their children and friends had transformed the kitchen into a beachfront paradise, taken pictures then eliminated all the evidence. It was a master stroke, Mr. Ritter wrote. I still sit here shaking my head. But being too good at April Fools jokes can get you into trouble. Listener Santiago Zorzopolous Rage(ph) wrote to us that his annual jokes on his mother had become the stuff of legends. Writing to us on April Fool's Day, he said, so I wasn't particularly surprised at my mother's suspicious attitude this morning. I called her with great news: my wife is pregnant. I'm about to become a father. She laughed, asking where'd you buy the baby, explaining that she wasn't going to fall for it this year. The kicker?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I guess the first and most obvious question is do we know how salamanders regrow their limbs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, what do we know? I mean, what do you do in the lab?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, they become stem cells sort of?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, have you put your finger on a conductor in the salamander?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that mean that with your research as a basis we may not have the problem of missing arms and legs anymore? We may be able to regrow arms and legs and even organs and things?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, David Gardiner, why can't we humans do this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who is this woman?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And first, from what you've been able to find out what's happening on hiring lines at day labor centers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now many of these people are migrant workers, they've migrated here. Are they typically on the move migrating to other places in the country where there might be more work than there is in the place where they have been living?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's an interesting - almost an irony here. If we see on a hiring corner a lot of people, that means the market is bad; there are a lot of job seekers and people are not being picked up and taken off to a job site somewhere?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If U.S. economic contraction were to persist for several months, if these were the conditions, and the end of every month looked as bad as the end of last month, let's say, in a hiring line, do you anticipate at some point that it would make more sense to either remain in Mexico and Central America or go back there than count on work like that in the U.S.?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have any sense of where in the country there actually is some work right now? And where have people gone and actually found a bright spot in the economy for day labor?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Quite a week, huh?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you saying that other small, low-cost carriers are going to be heading in the same direction, toward bankruptcy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " David, I want you to explain something to me because for a time, it seemed that the low-cost airlines had the winning formula for success in the industry, especially when compared with the big carriers like United, Delta and Northwest Airlines. Has that now changed with the rising price of fuel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what does this mean for customers? Can the low-cost carriers continue to offer bargain fares? What does it mean for people who need to go to Des Moines or Salt Lake City to see grandma or Aunt Millie?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First of all, you study online usage by teens and younger children. What can you tell us about how much time they typically spend online, and what the trends are?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We heard in Laura's story that whenever places like Facebook or MySpace offer privacy settings, people jump at them and use them. Do you think that's true, that kids really appreciate the privacy, or is the whole idea that you should put something out that everybody from Albuquerque to Zambia should be able to see?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As far as parents whose kids might be using these sites - I know you're not, you know, Pew isn't in the business of giving guidance, but personally, what did you think about this statement, I really can't tell my kid not to put her picture out on Facebook?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think, by the way, just get the sense that kids who are growing up doing all these things are going to be adults who will just have very different values about what is literally their space and what is public space where information about them is just shared widely?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And a plan of action, what does that usually entail?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's it like for you on the other end of those phone calls? What's the state of mind of these families when they place that call?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hang up the phone on you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you deal with the stress? How do you fight burnout?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " She does the listening when you get home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's been your worst day on the job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I know you have to protect your client's privacy, so I'm not going to ask you about specific individuals. But is there one case or one call that still haunts you that was just, you know, so tough for you that you still think about it even now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And they lost the house they owned?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The days when you leave a smile on your face. What would be your best day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Pittman, I imagined that there's someone who might even be listening to this conversation that has a stack of threatening letters from their lender. What's your best advice for them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If a family is strapped for cash, they can't pay the mortgage, how did they pay for your services?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I don't want to get too personal, but how long was it from your last shower?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've been living for sometime without access to water. What is that like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about restaurants and other businesses?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, first, what is behavioral finance?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So let me ask you this: why does this happen? Why won't homeowners lower their price when they're trying to sell their house and it's not selling?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what's this effect do to the housing market as a whole?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's really odd seeming. I mean, why in a worse market would they ask a much higher price for their house?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what does this do for all those buyers out there driving around looking at the signs on the front lawn? I mean, if people are looking for a bargain and they're finding prices that are set a lot higher this time, how do they and how should they react?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does this whole scenario play out? What happens? How does recovery happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much did that contribute to FEMA's apparent inability to respond quickly and efficiently to this disaster?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Michael Brown, who just resigned as the head of FEMA, was confirmed with very little scrutiny. Will his replacement face tougher questions about his credentials?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...respond to a big disaster. What does Katrina say about our preparedness?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...what would they be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...built before 1970 when modern building codes were put into effect and retrofitting got going. Does that mean that the majority of the buildings aren't earthquake-resistant? I mean, does it mean that San Francisco General Hospital, which is very old and in very bad shape, will fall down in an earthquake?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One thing about San Francisco in particular is I gather that about half the police and the firefighters live outside the city. So if the two bridges into the city are out, that--what does that do to your first responders?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But is there then a way to design neighborhoods so that poor people, poor families can emerge from poverty?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, given the cau--the damage and the level of damage in certain neighborhoods, does New Orleans offer an opportunity to do that kind of rebuilding?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What comes first? How does it work? What can you do? And what can't you do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, how did Robert Mugabe change and why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what were the decisions he made about the economy that have so devastated the country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Emira Woods, what are you predictions both for today's elections and, more importantly, for Zimbabwe's future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But can there really be a fix for those people in the negative equity situation, people whose house on the market right now is just worth substantially less than the loan they took out to buy the house?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In this - still very hypothetical example - the public funds might make up the difference between what the lender initially lent and what they're going to scale the loan down to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another dimension of the problems we're now seeing are the securitizing of mortgages help make a lot of money flow into home loans, and that made home buyers out of - a lot of people who couldn't even come up with a down payment, their presence in the market help keep house prices booming. Now, we see house prices coming down. What would it mean for our economy if both the rate of homeownership went down and home prices went down, say, for a couple of years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You actually took it for an expert consult?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, you're saying the activity of breaking in a glove is now - it's obsolete?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what do they sleep on at night? What do they put under the mattress at night?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Want to read one of the peons to your glove that you've included in your essay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And just to set the record straight, the glove we're looking at right now is not its pristine condition. You had it restored?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As the Democratic nomination is still contested and probably will be for another couple of months at least, what do you find about supporters of Clinton? What they make of Obama or supporters of Obama? What they make of Clinton?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The economy. Do you find people are not so optimistic obviously?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the good news in this survey for Senator John McCain?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Annie, what's the situation there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what about the upsurge of attacks on U.S. troops, and how are U.S. forces dealing with those attacks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In Basra, we hear about the Iraqi forces taking the lead with U.S. and Britain, perhaps providing air support or embedding some advisers along the way. There in Baghdad, has the balance of responsibility between the U.S. and the Iraqis, has it changed visibly to you or are the Americans doing what the Americans did last year and the year before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " More now on the Mahdi Army, the Iraqi government, and the fighting today in Iraq. Peter Harling is a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. He joins us from Damascus. He's traveled several times to Iraq over the years. And, Peter Harling, from what you understand, who has chosen this moment for a showdown? Is it the Mahdi army, is it its rival militia, or is it the government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But one explanation of moves against the Mahdi Army that we've heard in recent months is that there are many irregular units or splinter groups. People aren't following Moqtada al-Sadr's orders, and the crackdowns, therefore, are justified. What do you make of that rationale?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One interpretation of Moqtada al-Sadr's declaration of a ceasefire was that he foresees a U.S. withdrawal just beyond the horizon. Why get mixed up in fighting now when he could reassert himself in another year and a half or so?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that we should hear in that appeal for a civil resistance the implicit statement, this is our next-to-last option, if you don't respond to this, then we fight again?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What specifically more do you need to make a decision on his confirmation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In--excuse me, but intense test meaning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A lot of people thought the Roberts' hearings would set the stage for the fight over the next confirmation battle which was expected to be the confirmation of a chief justice. The equation has slipped somewhat, but is that, under current circumstances, still true? There is a second vacancy on the Supreme Court after John Roberts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " On that second nominee, though, who will be named, are you concerned about who that person might be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So when you encountered one of these people who had really lost everything or part of a neighborhood that was gone, what do you do as an insurance adjuster?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you relate to us a story of a single individual or a single family's claim?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Given the terribleness of this storm, have you found yourself having to make difficult choices?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wind-driven rain is not covered?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would that just more or less be a hurricane?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you responding to claims being made or are you going out cold to areas where you know you have people who are insured and they obviously probably will need to make a claim?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What has happened to you since last Friday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, may I ask if the staff managed to evacuate all of your patients alive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the Charity patients?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you tell if those two patients who did not make it might have lived had, you know, help come sooner, evacuation been earlier?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You told us last week about a particularly vivid-sounding case, a 15-year-old heart patient whose heart literally had to be pumped by hand as he was evacuated from the hospital. Do you know how he is now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, good news for you all. Before you left, conditions had deteriorated pretty badly. Would you remind us what it was like just as you were trying to get out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What impact is Katrina having on natural gas production?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, do you have a figure or an estimate of how high we might see natural gas prices go and also for how long?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why had the prices gone up so much before Katrina hit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is the US relying too heavily on natural gas to meet our energy needs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Besides concentrating on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, President Bush will have to deal with another vacancy on the Supreme Court. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died of cancer Saturday night. The president can either appoint a new Chief Justice or promote someone already on the bench. And joining me now is NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Good morning. NINA TOTENBERG reporting: Good morning, Renee. So the funeral for the Chief Justice coming up, plus hearings, how is--all this week, how is this going to work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what is the challenge then for the administration? What does it face with this vacancy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is anything known at this point about how the president--who and how the president may nominate the next Chief Justice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Nina, thanks very much. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. And you are listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News. From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. It was just the news Bear Stearns shareholders were hoping for. JPMorgan Chase agreed to boost the price it's paying for stock in the troubled investment bank today from $2 a share to $10. Wall Street was glad to hear that stocks rallied again today. But the move is likely to lead to even more criticism of the takeover deal and the government's role in it. We'll talk about that in a few minutes. First, NPR's Jim Zarroli is following the story in New York. And Jim, they had a deal, so why did JPMorgan Chase feel that it needed to pay more?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, was there an indication today that shareholders are more likely to accept this deal than the lower price from last week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the Federal Reserve played a role in engineering this acquisition. Did it have any response to the change in the terms today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When the Federal Reserve hatched the JPMorgan takeover at Bear Stearns, it was said that this was no bailout. Seeing your stock plummet to $2 a share was more like bankruptcy than a bailout. What about $10 a share?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you explain something? For a stock to go from $2 to $10 over the course of a week - of course, it's nothing compared to what it was trading for a year ago, but even so, it's going up five-fold, how can there be such disparate evaluations of what Bear Stearns is worth from one Monday to the next Monday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " JPMorgan's stock has also had a pretty good week since this deal was hatched. Again, can the Fed take some credit for boosting the value of JPMorgan's stock?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to ask you a question that addresses your specialty of corporate governance. My understanding was the people at Bear Stearns who were negotiating last week - well, as we have seen they faced a shareholder revolt, and yet, they were able to create 95 million new shares, sell them to JPMorgan, and I gather by doing so, avoid or overcome a shareholder revolt. Can the management or the directors of an investment bank simply create tens of millions of shares at will in that way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is the story of Bear Stearns a case of the market regulating itself, or the case of the absence of regulation leading to financial disaster?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Set the scene for us. What was it like to live in Belfast during the 1970s and '80s?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Brendan McAllister, Northern Ireland is viewed widely as a success story - a story of peace, as you say. How closely does the reality on the ground resemble our image of this peace story?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's great to have you here. Now, how did the idea for this project begin?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about some of your posts and some of the things that you found. You've spoken with astonishing assortment of characters. The child of a Philippine prostitute and an American serviceman, a Pakistani rock star who sang the \"Bin Laden Blues.\" Did you set out to find such colorful characters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what did the Pakistani drag queen say about America?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did the child of the Philippine prostitute and an American serviceman say to you about America?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did this trip change your feelings about your country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a specific time when you came to understand this? You started to understand this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's a link to his posts at our Web site, npr.org. From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Andrea Seabrook. Few American allies are more critical to the Bush administration's fight against Islamic extremism than Pakistan. But the country's turbulent politics and President Pervez Musharraf's shaky hold on power have raised questions about how reliable a partner Pakistan will be. Those questions weren't resolved today, but we did get a hint. The party of assassinated former leader Benazir Bhutto named its candidate for prime minister: Yousaf Raza Gillani. He's all but certain to be elected to the position by the national assembly on Monday. NPR's Philip Reeves is in the Pakistani capital Islamabad. And Philip, first, who is Yousaf Raza Gillani?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For a little perspective, Philip, how much power does the prime minister have in the Pakistani government, especially compared with the president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Philip, the government now is an alliance between the two parties that oppose President Musharraf - the parties of Bhutto and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. How is that going to work with President Musharraf still in power?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Philip, bringing it back to a strategic U.S. interest. I understand the Pakistani leaders have been speaking publicly about altering the government's approach to fighting Islamic extremists in the tribal areas. What do these government leaders have in mind?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The stalled U.S. economy is even worrying the folks at Google, the Internet heavyweight that has seemed incapable of making a wrong move. Google's market value has been sagging, but this week brought some good new for Google investors. The FCC agreed to open up a portion of the wireless airwaves. Here's the deal: This part of the spectrum won't belong to any one cell phone company; it'll be open to all comers. And that's where Google comes in. The company has been looking to get into the cell phone industry. For years now, bloggers and tech heads have whispered this word, Gphone. Depending on who you ask, Google's cell phone would be free. It would be sleek. It would kill Apple's iPhone. It would make you thin. Okay, no one ever claimed that. Then, in November, the big news came. Unidentified Woman: After months of waiting, Google has unveiled a strategy for Internet on portables. No Gphone to compete with iPhone, but a project called Android. Android. Bloggers and techies reacted to Google's announcement with a collective cry of huh? No Gphone? What's Android? I went to Silicon Valley to find out. I strolled onto the Google campus, past the volleyball court and the free bikes parked everywhere. I made my way to a conference room that seemed normal except for a weird videogame controller in the form of a drum set sitting in the corner. There, I sat down with Google's chief cell phone guy, Andy Rubin. So where's the Gphone?"}

You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News. The Red Cross in Houston says the Astrodome is already full. Officials there had announced plans to take in 23,000 refugees from New Orleans. But by early this morning, after accepting some 11,000 refugees, they stopped letting people in. That's left busloads of angry, tired and hungry people wondering where they'll end up. NPR's Robert Smith has been at the Astrodome all night and he joins us now. Robert, what happened? ROBERT SMITH reporting: Well, the Red Cross really underestimated the challenge of dealing with this flood of refugees. You have to remember, it was 24 hours ago when a Red Cross official told me that maybe they could do 45,000. And then that was downgraded to 25, 23,000. And then just last night after 11,000 people were in the Astrodome, we heard stories of food and clothing shortages, that there were no cots left inside, they didn't have enough volunteers. And the fire marshal decided that it was a threat to public safety and public health and for the comfort of the people who were in the Astrodome and decided to shut down the door. Well, the problem was that there were hundreds of buses already on the way for New Orleans, and they were arriving, you know, every few minutes at the Astrodome, and that first they were going to turn them away and send them to other cities, but in the end they relented and let these buses in and decided to open another building close to the Astrodome as a sort of temporary facility while they figure out where they're going to put these people. And what was the scene was like there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you've been talking of course to these refugees from New Orleans all night. What are they telling you about what's happening inside the Astrodome?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, with tens of thousands of refugees headed towards Houston, where are they going to go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the hospitals in New Orleans having to cope with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how many of these patients are too sick really to move?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you say staging area. But what then? How do they--where are they going? What other hospitals?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, in New Orleans as in other areas hard hit by the hurricane, the mayor has said rescue efforts are the top priority. Workers aren't dealing with dead bodies right now even if they see them in the flood waters. Will that become a health problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much is Hurricane Katrina going to cost insurers, by your estimates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When insurance companies come up with these figures, what do they take into account?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So this is, I mean, houses all the way to oil companies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now are most people insured for hurricanes in those areas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now in the event that a person, a homeowner or a business isn't covered by private insurance, where does the federal government come in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if you didn't?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Of all the issues that are being dealt with there, what would you say are the biggest that you're dealing with right now today in the short term?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you give us an example of a story that has come in to your office of someone needing to be rescued, to give us a feeling about what people are going through right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Commentator Judy Muller teaches journalism at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communication. This is NPR News. Mississippi suffered some of the heaviest damage from Hurricane Katrina. The Gulf Coast areas around Gulfport and Biloxi are among the hardest hit. Federal and state authorities are rushing emergency supplies and assistance to the region, and search and rescue operations continue today in heavily flooded areas. Thousands of people remain in shelters, unable to return to their home. NPR's David Schaper is in Jackson, Mississippi. And, David, tell us this morning, what is the latest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And with a huge rescue and recovery operation going on, what do you know about what will be happening today?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " David, thanks very much. NPR's David Schaper in Jackson, Mississippi. This is NPR News. A suicide bomber struck inside Israel over the weekend. The bomber died in yesterday's attack in the southern city of Beersheba. Two Israeli guards were badly injured. It was the first such attack since Israel's withdrawal from Gaza. Palestinian leaders condemned the attack, saying continued violence threatens efforts to restart the peace process and rebuild the Gaza Strip. Nigel Roberts is World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza. He joins us from Jerusalem. And may I ask you just what is happening now in the immediate aftermath of Israel's withdrawal from Gaza?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A major problem for Palestinians in Gaza is unemployment, and most particularly among young men. How is the Palestinian Authority--how would the World Bank encourage creating jobs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Palestinians want to build a seaport and a functioning airport. What kind of planning and cooperation will they need from the Israelis to do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here's another question. This one's from Bill Caesar(ph) in Durham, North Carolina and he's asking, given the current financial crisis, is it still safe to keep savings in a money market mutual fund that is not federally insured? Should people keep their emergency funds in a bank savings account or CD instead? What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And we did have some listeners wondering, you know, given what happened to Bear Stearns, is my bank safe?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here's another e-mail. This one is from Georgia Hennicoff(ph) in Seattle. She says, she and her husband are both 62 years old, very conservative investors. They had invested in mutual funds, took a bath there. Now, they're in bonds and CDs, wondering whether that's such a good idea. And she's asking where can conservative investors like us who are nearing retirement put our savings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look at all the turmoil going on right now, a lot of people are looking at it and saying, there's an opportunity here. And one of those who people who (unintelligible) is Stephanie Johnson(ph) of Washington, Connecticut. She says she's under 30. She has some disposable income. She wants to invest for the long-term. She says, if investing now is the way to go, is it a better opportunity to put money into the stock market or in real estate, or should she hold onto her money?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What would have happened without this bailout of Bear Stearns? What would the worst-case scenario have been?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If Bear Stearns had gone under, had declared bankruptcy, what would the ripple effects of that have been?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, talked this weekend and he used the term moral hazard to describe the risks of a bailout like the one the Fed did, but he said the stability of the markets required it. What do you think he means when he talks about a moral hazard? What's he talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look at these actions that the Fed has taken very quickly, this bailout of Bear Stearns, the open-ended lending program for a number of other investment banks, what do you think that says about the view that the Federal Government should stay out of financial markets?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how did that truck flip over?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was the driver or anyone else hurt in that accident?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we should explain why so many beekeepers might actually be in the area. As I understand, you have a lot of big rigs carrying big loads of bees from around the country at this time of the year. Why this bee pilgrimage to California?"}

It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Jacki Lyden. Andrea Seabrook is away. President Bush is more likely to vote for Ralph Nader in the next election than he had taught of the word recession. But this past week a lot of other people were using the word as well, and it's hard to blame them. The economy is looking mighty bad. There have been further signs of consumer retrenchment, a second monthly drop in employment and a financial crisis on Wall Street. To learn more about it we turn to NPR's global business correspondent Adam Davidson in New York. Adam, welcome. Adam, I understand that this week for the first time some key figures did go ahead and call it an economic recession. Who's using the R word now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what can the government do then in the event of a recession?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Adam, speaking of punishing bad actors, on Friday the Federal Reserve helped arrange a bailout of Bear Stearns, one of Wall Street's biggest firms. What's going on with that this week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The economy has been through several cycles of recession in the last several decades. Is there anything positive about recessions?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, explain the bracket system to me, would you please, Luke?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what goes on in the selection? Is it really as dramatic as we described?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I guess the drama moves to the Internet because within seconds of the NCAA's announcements, the brackets get emailed out to prospective gamblers. So does this mean that office gambling is legal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That is listener Fran Hill of Ephrata, Pennsylvania. She completed last week's homework assignment on obsolete skills. When we talked with her she gave us the idea for this week's assignment. She told us how nice the weather was in her part of Pennsylvania this month. And that got us to wondering, of course, whether March indeed still comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb. And that got us wondering about the fate of many of the other great old weather proverbs. And so for this week, we're asking you to update your favorites. Some may need a rethink because of climate change. This well, maybe they just got old. Send your new weather proverbs to homework@npr.org or call the Homework hotline; it's 202-408-5183 - 202-408-5183. You will hear the happy voice of our regular host, Andrea Seabrook, welcoming you. And be sure to tell us your name and how to contact you. Frances Hill's essay got us to thinking about creases and folds, and the properties that govern the edges. And so that is subject for this week's Science Out of the Box. Dr. L. Mahadevan teaches applied mathematics at Harvard University. He has taught a lot about wrinkles and folds, and he's kind enough to join us to talk about them. Welcome, sir. Dr. L. MAHADEVAN (Applied Mathematics Professor, Harvard University): Thank you very much. Well, let's get to the big one here. Here's a roadmap of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It's all pristine, but if I unfold it and just look at a little bit, it's going to be a mess when I start to fold it back up. Why is that? Why is it so hard to put it back together?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Right. This map has two horizontal folds and nine going cross vertical folds. How many possible ways could you fold this map back up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Right. So you should be looking at the memory at the fold line, the crease, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We tried to follow these directions and make a map here in the studio, a Muira map. It's beautiful, but it took 20 minutes to fold up this piece of paper. Is there a way to do this sort of elegant folding without computers and without a machine and without taking 20 minutes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And would you find the same sort of process replicated in nature?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you get - deepen the nature here, it is some of a directed, really, out of more practical way to make a roadmap for us in the car?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK. You're making this argument that people should put more money in foreign stocks. Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are some parts of the world to aim for if you're thinking about investing overseas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the risks? What are the pitfalls to avoid here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Isn't there an additional risk here simply because the value of the dollar can move and completely scramble your investments?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I understand that two pro-government clerics were also killed over the weekend in the south of the country. What can you tell us about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You have heard these reports yourself?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " On both sides?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The frustration and the anger that youre talking about, is it because China is seen as essentially suffocating Tibetan culture and denying freedoms? Whats the root of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is, of course, so much scrutiny right now on the government of China because of the upcoming Olympics in Beijing. Do you think that in any way binds the government and how it can react and how far they might go in cracking down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I hate to put you in a position of predicting disaster, but are you anticipating a crackdown on the scale of what we saw in Tiananmen Square in 1989?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. It was a historic day and not in a good way for the U.S. dollar. It reached a record low against the euro, and the dollar fell below 100 yen for the first time in more than a decade. There was another sign of weakness - retail sales were down in February. And despite all these the stock market closed higher. NPR's Adam Davidson is here to explain this confusing picture. And Adam, first, what's behind the dollar's continued slide here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With the average Americans - assuming we're not, say, traveling in Europe or Asia right now - would we be feeling the effect of a weaker dollar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If we're not feeling the main effects of the weak dollar right now, when might we feel them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I was reading on your Web site that your company represents global leadership in fire protection. What does your company make?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when the dollar is sliding, as it has been, your exports, I gather, are going way up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who's buying now? Which countries are buying now that may not have been before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Groos, when you wake up - as you must have this morning - to hear the news that the dollar is at a record low in Europe, at a 12-year low against the yen, do you wake up thinking, gosh, that's good news for my company or that's bad news or something in the middle?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You must travel overseas a lot for your work. When you do that, do you really notice it now that the dollar is just buying way, way less overseas than you're used to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So that $500-and-up hotel room in London, do you get breakfast for that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what are you paying for breakfast?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. And it still sets you back or is it okay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tom Groos is the chairman of the Viking Group which makes fire protection and suppression systems. It's based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. One of the claims the Bush administration made to justify the invasion of Iraq was that Saddam Hussein had ties to al-Qaida but a Pentagon-sponsored review of captured Iraqi documents has turned up no evidence of a direct operational link between Saddam Hussein's regime and Osama bin Laden's terror network. NPR's Tom Gjelten has been speaking with officials familiar with that review. He joins us now in the studio. Tom, did the Pentagon look specifically for any evidence of al-Qaida's link to Saddam Hussein?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell us a little bit more about the documents that were reviewed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If Saddam Hussein was not involved with al-Qaida, what was thought out about how he viewed terrorism or how it could be used against his enemies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So using al-Qaida methods, do these documents tell us anything about how Saddam Hussein viewed Osama bin Laden?"}

He's got a round face, glasses and an outfit you'd see on any IT guy this side of the Pacific, slacks and a white and blue dress shirt, casual jacket. He works in a cubicle, and on his desk are a couple photos of his wife, a few books and a tower of granite blocks. Are those awards that are stacked up there?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " To Redmond, once a month?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to begin with some of these keynote speakers, Mark Zuckerberg, that 23-year-old billionaire founder of Facebook appeared at the festival. Did he reveal any secrets about Facebook's future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So this was just spontaneous? He called people, he said, do anybody have a secret they like to share?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So first off, we heard Jason Beaubien report on this knock-on effect of diverting corn into fuel. How big of a factor is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So corn syrup, in that case, we're talking about everything from ketchup to salad dressing to fruit juice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And to what degree do transportation costs drive up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what else is driving up the cost of groceries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, food prices are going up here in the U.S. Just in the U.S., or are grocery prices are going up in other parts of the world as well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does this mean for organic farmers, for those dairy farms, for instance, that produce organic milk or cage-free eggs that are generally more expensive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we're hearing that milk prices have jumped 26 percent, egg prices 40 percent. What do you see when you look into the future? Where do you project prices will go from here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the Gaza Strip and southern Israel, a fragile calm is in effect but there appears to be no formal truce. In fact, both sides deny that there's any ceasefire at all. What's clear is that after nearly two weeks of bloodshed and rocket fire, Israeli forces and Palestinian militants have stopped shooting at each other. Israel says its forces have halted ground and air attacks. Egypt is now trying to capitalize on that calm by mediating a real ceasefire, but there is deep skepticism that the peace will last. Joining us from Jerusalem now is NPR's Eric Westervelt. And Eric, the drop in violence in the last three days in Gaza and southern Israel is substantial. What's behind it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But neither side is acknowledging or claiming that there's been some sort of ceasefire negotiated?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the bark beetles feed on the trees. Is there anything out there that feeds on the bark beetles?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Large enough appetite to keep the pest in check?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How was it that the bark beetle, of all the insects that are out there, that this one bug winds up being the harbinger pest, the pest that tells us the most about climate change?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If the tree was healthy, what could it do to send off the bark beetle?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're trying to get people not to get so excited about the real estate market, not to spend quite so much. Why aren't they listening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are people actually saying, `I've got to buy something now because prices are going to keep going up and up, and I'll never get in the market'?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Don't want to get you in trouble with your neighbors in Florida, but when people on the same block are buying a house for twice what you paid, are you thinking, `Stupid'?"}

Maybe, you knew about it already, but if not, think people who don't want people to know things and end up being among the most unhappy people in the world. We were reading about a Swiss bank, Bank Julius Baer, that was upset about documents leaked to the Web site, Wikileakes.org. The bank asked a federal judge to shut down the Web site and the judge obliged, which of course, made the case compelling reading not just for people concerned about allegations of money laundering in the Cayman Islands, but also people concerned about free speech on the Internet. Arguably, more people sought and found the documents after the Web site was shut down than before.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's get beyond the taxonomy of economic woes and definitions here. You warned that if the Federal Reserve does now what it did it the '70s to cope with stagflation, if there were a policy responding to that sort of problem, it would be making a big mistake. Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that mean that what Chairman Bernanke said today, that he will remain more concerned about growth than about inflation, strike you as the right balance at this point, do you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what, though - if this is not this, whatever recession we're in, whether it's just a slowdown or a true recession, what if it's not a recession that is cyclical and weeds out inefficiencies and gives rise to new, stronger growth? What if there's something in the bursting of the subprime bubble that really bespeaks more profound problems for the economy, would the Fed then be right to be much more weary of slowed growth than to many things else?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And first, why did you call Senator Obama, Barack Hussein Obama a few times in your remarks yesterday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " like that at all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what do you make then of Senator McCain saying yesterday that -well, it seems like you're unwelcome. You've said that you were asked by his campaign to make remarks like these, or what were you asked to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, who used the phrase red meat, give them some raw meat or whatever it was? Your - is that your characterization, or did Mike DeWine said it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " objected to what you said. What do you make of Senator McCain now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you going to support Hillary Clinton now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in tonight's debate, it's hard for me to ask you what Senator Clinton needs to do because she seems to have tried to do everything already. What do you expect to happen tonight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's say that she does very well in the debate and goes on to win in Ohio next week or for that matter in Ohio and Texas, does she considerably retake the lead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as of now, before their primaries in Texas and Ohio, the gap in delegates is about what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was the truth to the story that Aaron had posted a threat to rape this girl on a chat room?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, this angry mission to redeem the honor of the 15-year-old girl sets off for the White house from the birthday party?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Mr. White was charged with manslaughter. Was it second degree manslaughter (unintelligible)?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the philharmonic is going to play Gershwin, Dvorak's \"New World Symphony,\" Wagner's \"Prelude to Act 3 of Lohengrin,\" and they have a Korean folk song prepared as an encore. What does that program say to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You think that in a let's-break-the-ice-after-more-than-half-a-century concert, not the moment to play Pierre Boulez or something like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are these signature pieces of the New York Philharmonic?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're inside the national assembly. Could you give us a little description of the atmosphere there now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, first let's go to Raul Castro. Was Raul the only contender for the post-president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you've written a biography of Raul Castro. He's effectively been exercising presidential powers for the last 19 months, ever since Fidel became more seriously ill. Now that he's officially president, can we expect him to deviate from his brother's path?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how do you think he might deviate from Fidel's past?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where do you think this is going to leave relations with the United States as it faces Raul and a, you know, seriously aged band of former revolutionaries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thanks for being with us. You're a supporter of Senator Clinton's and her campaign seems to be running into difficulty as Barack Obama keeps up racking up wins in primaries and caucuses. Do you think that the tougher tone she's taken this weekend when she denounced Senator Obama's ads and flyers is a good strategy for her?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think Senator Clinton needs to do to connect better with the voters as she prepares for these truly make or break primaries in Ohio and Texas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I wanted to ask you now about the delegate situation in Michigan. The Democratic National Committee says that the state is to be penalized for moving up its primary, of course is what they've been saying. The committee said it wouldn't seek or count any of your delegates at the convention. Will you now support Senator Clinton's bid to get the Michigan delegates seated?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " for Michigan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's say that your nightmare scenario does happen. It isn't fixed; the race goes all the way to the convention. It could happen. And you are a superdelegate at that convention, committed to Senator Clinton. But let's say that Senator Obama has more votes in these primaries. Would you remain committed if the delegates are the crucial and deciding factor? Will you remain committed to Senator Clinton?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you ever think about 1968?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Our political coverage continues just ahead with a Republican governor who welcomes a face-off between Senators McCain and Clinton or Obama in November. You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Jacki Lyden. We continue our political coverage now. Just a few minutes ago, we had on Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, a Clinton supporter. Republican Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana is here as well in Washington for the winter meeting of the National Governors Association. I also spoke with him about the presidential race. Governor Daniels, Senator McCain is the presumptive Republican nominee now, and last week when the New York Times published an article suggesting that he had an improper relationship with a lobbyist, Republican conservatives publicly rushed to his defense. Do you think the Republican establishment is worried that some of these charges could stick and should they be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As he moves to shore up his support with conservatives he, of course, has always enjoyed the support of Independents. Do you think he risks alienating Independents as he courts conservative voters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Give me a definition, please, when you say left wing. What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you worried that Democratic base has been more energized by what you characterize as the romance of Barack Obama, that the turnout which we've seen record turnouts in primaries and caucuses mean that some Republicans might stay at home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Turkish troops pursued their new offensive today against Kurdish rebel bases across the border in northern Iraq. There was heavy fighting leaving dozens dead and the rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, shot down a Turkish helicopter. The Turkish government launched its offensive on Thursday after denouncing Iraq for failing to put down the PKK rebels, a group the United States and European Union consider a terrorist organization. NPR's Ivan Watson has been following the story from Istanbul. Ivan, what can you tell us about the current situation and this helicopter being shot down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, Ivan, this has been going on in terms of attention for a long time. Do the Turkish soldiers involved appear to be settling in for a long, drawn-out battle and do you known how many there might be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As you know this puts the United States in a difficult position, allied with Turkey but also with the Kurds in Northern Iraq. What diplomatic moves should we be looking for in the next few days?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you remind people, please, our listeners, of who Sergio de Mello was and what the path was that he took to become one of the world's most prominent diplomats?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why was he deployed so ubiquitously?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So by the time the invasion of Iraq was looming in 2003 it was rumored that he was going to be Kofi Annan's special representative there. He had just come from East Timor where he'd had quite a successful couple of years. But he himself was ambivalent about the job and it was true that many U.N. staff were very opposed to U.N. involvement in Baghdad. So why did he go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So he goes to Baghdad in June 2003, sets up U.N. offices at the Canal Hotel, intended to leave at the end of September but he never made that because, of course, of the attack. Regarding the attack, the U.N. would later come in for severe criticism about its lack of security arrangements, the road that ran behind the Canal Hotel was opened, the windows weren't taped, there weren't enough guards. Why didn't de Mello take greater precautions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Fifteen or 20 percent before or after taxes, if I can ask?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And does that apply to people that make $200,000 a year, as well as people who make $25,000 a year? Is there a difference there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have in mind--and we're looking 20 or 30 years into your future. Do you have in mind that you'll be retiring around 65 or will you work longer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you already kind of in that category, barely working, there in your early 40s and just kind of skating?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's the one I want to ask about. Why big business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Center for Responsive Politics said that you received $2.4 million or so from political action committees, from various businesses. Is there a contradiction there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I guess the fundamental question there is, is there a tension in the Republican coalition, that's been very successful in recent years, that needs to be resolved in some way between the business wing and the wing that you represent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to ask about a couple of other items here. President Bush in the last several days has said that he believes intelligent design, the idea that there is a creator behind the work of the world that we see, that intelligent design should be taught in schools. What do you think of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...why does that particular item of the academic curriculum concern you as a United States senator?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why would those holes matter to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you reading from a list there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the coming weeks, the US Senate will be considering the nomination of John Roberts to the US Supreme Court, President Bush's first pick. What do you want to hear from John Roberts when he speaks to the Senate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When the newest Supreme Court justice considers a case in Roe vs. Wade, which seems entirely likely, how should that justice regard the past 32 years of precedents which have found in favor of a right to life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Commentator Sandip Roy is host of \"UpFront\" on member station KALW in San Francisco. You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News. We're going now to Rome where Italian magistrates are considering a British request for the extradition of that suspect. He was arrested in Rome Friday after an international manhunt. And NPR's Sylvia Poggioli has been covering this story. He's been interrogated, this man, Sylvia. What's emerged? SYLVIA POGGIOLI reporting: Well, his court-appointed lawyer, Antonetta Sonnessa, has said he admits taking part in the July 21st attacks, but didn't want to blow anything up. He claims they wanted to scare the British people, not kill them. And she quoted him as saying, \"I am not a terrorist.\" And that he said he has no connection with the July 7th attackers or with al-Qaeda. Now unconfirmed Italian media reports say the suspect told investigators the July 21st attackers wanted revenge for the suffering inflicted on Iraqis by British and American troops. Now what more is known about this man?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you mentioned fitting the pattern of Islamic extremism. Authorities believe this man got help in the operation from an Islamic network in Italy. What's come of that part of the investigation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK. So we mentioned that Italian magistrates are considering this British request for extradition. Is there any question, any doubt about whether Osman Hussain will be sent back to Britain to face criminal charges?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sylvia, thanks very much. That's NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Florence, Italy. This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd has died. For nearly a quarter of a century he was the ruler of one of America's most important allies. For the last decade of his life, however, King Fahd was incapacitated by a series of strokes. His younger brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, was the effective leader. Two months ago, King Fahd was admitted to a hospital with pneumonia. Upon his death, he was believed to be 84 years old. We're going to learn more about King Fahd from Gwenn Okruhlik. She's a visiting scholar at the University of Texas who completed a Fulbright Scholarship in Saudi Arabia. She's done extensive field work in the country and she joins us now. Gwenn, how significant a ruler was King Fahd?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do you think that was a significant moment because this is the moment when King Fahd began making compromises with religious hard-liners?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a contradiction here in that King Fahd was seen as compromising with extremists at the same time that he was a very close ally to the United States and even invited American troops into his country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that a reflection of the tension in Saudi Arabia generally?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the next king will be Crown Prince Abdullah, who has been the effective ruler for a decade now. Can we expect any significant changes in policy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And King Fahd has died at the age of 84. This is NPR News. From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Jacki Lyden. Andrea Seabrook is on assignment. Serb demonstrators marched for the sixth day today in Northern Kosovo, protesting its independence from Serbia. In Belgrade this week, the protests turned violent as rioters attacked and set fire to the U.S. embassy on Thursday. That prompted the U.S. State Department to order non-essential employees and diplomats' families to leave. In a few minutes, we'll be speaking with a senior U.S. diplomat about the situation, but we begin our coverage with NPR's Sylvia Poggioli who's in Belgrade. Sylvia, what's the mood there in the Serbian capital two days after those riots?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As that rhetoric increases, what is the latest that the Serbian government has had to say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has anything further been learned about the identity of the rioters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sylvia, what about the Serbs - you mentioned about 200,000 possibly -who were demonstrating peacefully against Kosovo's independence? How do they feel about the West?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it has a lot of modern relevancy or, you know, a dreaded future scenario?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You have, however, often used the sort of scaffold of history to put your characters upon. You've modeled these characters on real-life people. Who are they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know what was so amazing for me in that passage, not only its resonance but that you even had the wind whistling through. In this novel, \"Life Class,\" I mean, you've started with the students painting from a nude model. Now Paul is bathing the wounds of men desperately tortured. How is he changed by that experience? How has his painting changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It seems as if the experiences of artists hold particular meaning for you. I mean, you mentioned Siegfried Sassoon and, of course, Wilfred Owen, and these people have appeared in your earlier works, and now this group you're writing about here are artists. Is there something about the template of imagination which makes war particularly vivid for artists?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what part of Jessica's Law has made it difficult for sex offenders to find housing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have any rough count of how many people have actually become homeless as a result of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how do authorities monitor sex offenders? Is this very hard?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But isn't it always hard to monitor somebody who doesn't have an address, who's homeless?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the recidivism rate? I mean, how does homelessness affect that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you please tell us about your work with Dr. Miller? I understand that he kept a vial of ammonia and cyanide at 100 degrees below zero Fahrenheit for 25 years. What were you looking for in that vial?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what gave him the idea that life might have begun in ice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what was that chemistry that took place? What did you call it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So by putting ammonium and cyanide in a vial and letting it sit for a quarter of a century, you actually recreated the building blocks of life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Four centimeters is how many inches?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the increased stroke risk could be independent of higher blood pressure, independent of higher incidence of diabetes. It could be purely related to weight gain and to body fat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was it the women who were technically obese who had the highest risk of stroke? I mean, does a very moderate weight gain seem to have any effect?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So why are businesses sitting on all that cash?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, is what's happening unusual or do businesses act like this for various reasons on a pretty regular basis?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is this something to worry about, David? I mean, is it an indicator of weakness in the economy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So when you walk around in the United States, in any American city, how does that city look different because the ADA was passed 15 years ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The act required people to take reasonable--not extreme, but reasonable steps to accommodate the disabled. Are the lives of disabled different than they were in terms of how much money they make, or anything else that gets tracked?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which they would lose if they took a job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What has happened to public attitudes toward the disabled in these 15 years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So on this 15th anniversary, what remains to be done in the area of the law and people with disabilities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Joe Shapiro, recently you've been reporting on American military personnel who returned from Iraq, wounded personnel. How does the Americans With Disabilities Act apply to them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wait a minute. They're not doing safety announcements? They're talking about the North Korean leadership on the way in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's often assumed that North Koreans try to send messages when they meet with private citizens from the outside. Did you get that sense when you were speaking with them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are they offering to give up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would this also apply to nuclear weapons held by the United States?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this remotely realistic?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The North Koreans want to hang on to their civilian nuclear program, which is a program that they were allowed to keep in the '90s, in the last round of negotiations, and ended up violating the agreement?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So now, Mr. Walsh, you've got this very unique window into these talks. You've spoken to North Korean officials. You've spoken to American officials. As these six-party talks resume, do you have a sense that there's a real opportunity to make progress here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk first about these two different groups that have claimed responsibility for the bombings. Want to find out who they are. First, what is the Abdullah Azzam Brigades?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now is part of the challenge here that you have these two groups that have claimed responsibility, but there's a whole list of groups that may be based in Egypt and some of them may be fictitious, some of them may be the same group by multiple names?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a piece of evidence that causes you to feel convinced that Zawahiri or bin Laden would have some connection to this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the next president will face a very difficult foreign policy agenda from Iraq to Iran, and South Korea, China. In that list of major challenges, what is Africa's strategic importance to the U.S.? How big a challenge does Africa present?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, this is a big continent, of course several issues. And some of those we've spent a good deal of time talking about in this program, particularly humanitarian issues and AIDS in Africa. We were hoping to tick through a few other issues. And I want to start with political instability. Kenya is not the only trouble spot in Africa. At same time, the U.S. is proving reluctant to involve itself directly in African democracy-building. Where might the next American president focus his or her attention?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If Kenya is a country that provides a cautionary tale for the next president, what lesson should they take?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we hear the current administration talk quite a bit about terrorism. But the focus is not usually on Africa. However, Osama bin Laden spent a good deal of time training in Sudan. We've seen Islamic militant's sweep to power in Somalia. Could East Africa potentially become the next Afghanistan? MR. LYMAN: I think it's a serious problem and the administration has had quite a big counterterrorism program in the Horn and East Africa. The only major stationing of U.S. troops on the continent of Africa is in Djibouti, in the Horn, with between 1,200 and 1,800 - depending on the time - amount of troops. And then we got heavily engaged in not only Sudan but in Somalia. We know that in there are extremist elements operating in that area and down the coast of East Africa taking advantage of a lot of opportunities. And it's important to focus on it. I think the policies that were followed recently in regard to Somalia has worsened the situation rather than improved it. So I think the next administration is going to face a very serious problem combining both stability and the potential for terrorism in the Horn and Eastern Africa. Now, when you say the missteps that were taken in Somalia and perhaps even Ethiopia. What, specifically, are you talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, U.S. depend on Africa for oil - increasingly depends on Africa for oil, people may not think about that one when they're filling up at the gas station. But much of that oil comes from countries that are very unstable -Nigeria, Chad, Equatorial Guinea as you note. So how does or when does the U.S. intervene politically in these countries? I mean, the U.S. doesn't necessarily intervene or point a finger at Saudi Arabia and tell that country what to do. Are the rules different when it comes to Africa?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is the United States government supporting the independence then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sylvia, let's just go back a minute and remind ourselves why we watched this situation in the Balkans so carefully. Nine years ago when NATO and the U.S. went to war over tiny Kosovo. Let's listen to this cut of President Clinton. Former President BILL CLINTON: United States forces acting with our NATO allies have commenced air strikes against Serbian military targets in the former Yugoslavia. Sylvia, how did the U.S. and NATO get there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sylvia, how is the Serbian government reacting to Kosovo's declaration of independence today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Russia is an ardent supporter of Serbia, and today it called an emergency session of the U.N. security council. The Russians demanded that the U.N. annul Kosovo's declaration of independence. After the council met, the Belgian ambassador read a statement, saying the council could not agree on the future of Kosovo. Western nations favor accepting its independence, while Russia wants it blocked. Diplomats have been trying to reach a solution acceptable to all sides for years, but those negotiations have reached an impasse. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli says Russia also counts on the fact that several European countries depend on it for energy supplies and do not want to enter into conflict with Moscow. In Afghanistan today, a suicide bomber walked into a crowded dog fighting arena in the southern city of Kandahar and killed at least 80 people. The suicide attack is being blamed on the Taliban. It's the worst in Afghanistan's troubled history. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Kandahar and she joins me now. Soraya, what's the scene in the city?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said that people were attending funerals today. Do they move that quickly from suicide attack to funeral in the same day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Soraya, do we know who this bomber was targeting or what the bomber's intentions were?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I know the Taliban often acknowledges its responsibility behind its suicide attacks. Has it acknowledged it behind this attack?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do that? Why target him in a public place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so, Soraya, where does that leave this city of Kandahar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Anandwan means forest of joy, and visitors say even the most outcast who live there work and play with a small on their face. Amte came from a moneyed family but a chance meeting with a homeless leper spurred him to establish Anandwan as a refuge. There he gave treatment to society's outcasts. He taught them to farm, weave and build machinery. Baba Amte often said of his leprosy patients, let them lose their limbs but not their dignity. His mission spread beyond Anandwan to other ashrams, hospitals, a university, and a school for blind children. Baba Amte was remembered with a state funeral last week and was buried on the grounds of Anandwan. Coming up on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, the NIH battles malaria in Africa. It's NPR News. Joining me now is NPR's senior Washington editor Ron Elving. He's been watching the primaries and caucuses coming up on Tuesday. And first of all, Ron, we just heard about the Democratic side in Hawaii. What's going with the Republicans there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. So looking forward to Tuesday, there are a couple of big events there. Washington State is one of them. There's a primary, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it mean that Obama and Clinton are actually not just competing each other but against John McCain and Mike Huckabee?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so, Ron, who's the favorite here? Who are the polls showing ahead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is all mixed up with Sudan, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you explain to people here who have a sense of the fighting in Darfur why they should then worry about Chad, why this isn't a different situation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are reports that gunmen in Eastern Chad are preventing the U.N. from moving refugees from the Darfur region into refugee camps in Chad. What can the United Nations do for the people in these camps?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about the worry about a possible backlog of some kind of warrant applications?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the role of the telecom companies in this process?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, when we talk about surveillance, for many people, that's the whole concept is just a little bit spooky. Who's actually being surveilled? Who are they actually looking at with these warrants?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your commute this morning, how did it go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell us about yesterday, when you heard about these latest explosions. I mean, what were you thinking? What went through your mind?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you got together, and I imagine you did, with friends and maybe family throughout the day and last night, what are people saying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you doing anything differently at all as far as traveling, commuting, living?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is an expression used in Western Europe, falling on one's sword. Is that part of this history of, in some sense, a suicide or attack or is it merely a suicide?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did it take until 1980 for suicide attacks, and then they were suicide bombings mostly, to really spread?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. Tom, the Mitchell report, as you mentioned, came out in December. This has been out there for some time. What came out today at the hearing that was new?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, Tom, today some of the committee members really went after the credibility of the trainer, Brian McNamee. Could that help Roger Clemens here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There were a few sort of sidebars to all of this. One, as we mentioned, that it come out that Roger Clemens' wife had used HGH. And then there's also a dispute at the hearing about the Clemens family's former nanny. How did that factor in here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you have pretty much the Clinton family ringing you up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What shows up on your caller ID when you get those calls?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what did - how did those conversations go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you know, Crystal, are there rules about what they can do, how far they can go to try to woo you to their side?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can they buy you stuff?"}

Instead, he'll tour several U.S. cities with large Mexican immigration populations - New York, Chicago and Los Angeles among them. While he's staying clear of U.S. politicians, Calderon is quoted in the New York Times as saying he hopes the next American president and members of Congress would have a wider, more positive, more rational vision of the immigration issue. That story was written by New York Times Mexico City Correspondent James C. McKinley, Jr. He's on the line there. Hello there, Jim McKinley. Mr. JAMES C.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wow. So does it work to put the brace on and, like, go shopping in the mall or stroll around? Or do you have to be constantly moving, sort of with purpose walking?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think this will be good for? I mean, these days we're all talking about having little solar panels to charge our cell phones and iPods. What do you envision this being used for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've called this a cocktail napkin idea. Did you actually have it at a party and did you actually write it down on a cocktail napkin?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Andrea Seabrook. Super Tuesday is still reverberating in American politics, but there are new results today from four more states. The Kansas Republican caucuses went overwhelmingly for Mike Huckabee. Kansan's seem to reject the notion that John McCain has the race all sewn up. Both parties compete in caucuses in Washington and primaries in Louisiana today. And Democrats caucus in Nebraska. Joining me here in the studio is NPR senior Washington editor Ron Elving. Ron, let's start with what we know at this point. Kansas has gone for Huckabee. What are the numbers and was this a surprise?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Interesting there. And so what do we know about Nebraska at this point, Ron?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. Okay. So we'll wait for results there. What about the other events today? Both parties compete in Washington and Louisiana. Do we have any idea about those?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. NPR's senior Washington editor, Ron Elving. Stay with me here while we check in with Louisiana and NPR's Greg Allen, who's on the line from a polling station in New Orleans. Greg, tell us about the level of voter interest in these primaries today. You've got both Republicans and Democrats voting, correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So have you seen a lot of candidates coming through the state there, Greg?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Listeners may remember your name, actually - I want to remind them - from your famous discovery, tiktaalik. Is that - am I pronouncing that right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So let's look at our hands here. I want to sit here and look at my hand. I'm familiar with how the bones look if I were to put my hand under an x-ray machine. So which bones in there correspond to which bones in your fish-a-pod, tiktaalik?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you see in the human body these relics of our own evolution?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the reason he invented this high collar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, first of all, what is the answer? Are you ready now to close ranks behind John McCain and forgive him what you might see as his shortcomings because he's most likely to be the Republican nominee?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we should just clarify. Although it does appear that Senator Mc Cain has the nomination, Mike Huckabee is still out there and that you don't see as a realistic option at this point, do you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A prime time speech at the convention for Mitt Romney - that would be worth something?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Forty months?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, is suspending a presidential campaign a bit like going out of business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Accountants. So let's start there with the money. What happens to the money?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if you use your own money, can you repay yourself?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happens to all those?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you recycled some of those?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know in the last few weeks, there has been this surreal battle over the sort of heart of conservatism in the party. And Mitt Romney has faced this constant criticism that he was a bit late to this because he had changed his policy, his stands on some issues that are sort of key to conservative orthodoxy. Do you think that that was one of the things that was just really hard for him to deal with, that constant barrage of criticism about him being a flip-flopper?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He also had to deal with one thing that was very difficult for the campaign from the very beginning, the question of him Mormonism. Do you think that that in the end was a bit of a millstone for him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was he dismissed because of that or did he say some degree of discrimination because of his faith?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, bank in July - I was looking at a fortune magazine piece. Back in July, some of his advisers were encouraging him to take off the suit. You know, loosen up a little bit. We saw that as he went further into the campaign. You saw more often in a windbreaker than in a business suit. Do you think that if he had done that earlier, people might have seen something different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where do the party's core conservative voters go now? Will they back John McCain?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look at the returns in other states and see which groups voted for whom in the Democratic side; say for Obama or for Clinton. If you took those demographics and played them out through Virginia, which side looks at Virginia and says that's my kind of state?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happens in districts that have an even number of delegates, say four or six delegates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Apart from the delegates that are allocated by congressional district, there are also about 30 percent of the total in California that are going to be allocated based on the primary vote statewide. How does that work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it seem likely to you, Professor Cain, that you could be looking at a result after tonight's vote in California where one candidate clearly won the popular vote and the other candidate seems to have gotten more delegates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Bruce Cain is a political science professor at UC Berkeley. Now, we've got just a minute left. And NPR's Mara Liasson is still with us in the studio. Mara, just a day before this big contest tomorrow, what's most important and what's next for the Democrats?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is nothing in golf quite like the British Open, is there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the last time the British Open was played at St. Andrews, Tiger Woods won. I mean, he walked away with it. Is he a favorite again this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The last two years, the championship has been won by really unknowns, Ben Curtis and Todd Hamilton. We talk about this. How unusual is this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Talk to us, John, about golf's current big four. I mean, who among them has a shot here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if you had to sit down with an investor--you, you know, Dennis Campbell--what would you say to that investor right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ballard is a Canadian company, but in this case, you know, President Bush has talked a lot about supporting alternative fuels like hydrogen, but the big infrastructure investment has yet to be made. Can companies like yours succeed, and how do you do it if the government doesn't follow through?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Last Thursday, that was the day of the bombings in London, your police force reportedly recorded something like 28 calls from riders about suspicious packages. What were they reporting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, there are some urban transit systems that give lists of what a suspicious person might look like, and on the list is something like people who appear lost, or people who seem to be perspiring. I mean, how can you narrow it and frame it that way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's been nine months now since Chief Justice Rehnquist announced that he has thyroid cancer, but he has kept working just as much as he has been able to do. Is there any health benefit to that as far as you know?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. Now I don't want to sound ageist but I will risk it for this ques--I'm the last one to do that, but I'll risk it for this question. What about the quality of the work that we do as we get older? Obviously, we--you know, if you're going to do heavy lifting, heavy physical labor, we can't do that as well as we get older. What about the mental work, mental agility?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand that Japan has one of the highest percentages of older people in their work force. Something like 20 percent of people over the age of 65 keep on working there. So what can we learn from the Japanese?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have financial markets built in an expectation that the world's economy will keep on chugging along despite an attack?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We all know that, you know, financial markets to some extent depend on consumer attitude. How is that at work here, if at all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Given that, as we've said, earnings season really gets going this week. What do you expect to see this time around?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when companies last reported earnings, the price of oil was still under $60. Actually shocking to talk about `still under $60.' Do you expect to see any impact on corporate profits this time around from the high price of oil?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what would you worry about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, let's talk about John McCain first. He's pulled way ahead. Who is he winning with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does that mean for Mitt Romney? Is he losing those people or it sounds like maybe he's just staying steady?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what does that say to you that the polls are so unstable here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I love this. I love this part of the poll. It's about voter happiness. What does this mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Romney, Mitt Romney, went to a funeral today, the funeral of Gordon Hinckley, the former head of the Mormon Church. What has Romney's strategy been in the days leading up to the Super Tuesday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How important is it that there is this huge refugee situation, people fleeing the Darfur region of Sudan into Chad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the big story here is that New England is on the doorstep of a perfect season. What do you expect from the Patriots tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. Now, I'm going to admit that I'm more of a commercials and halftime show sort of Super Bowl watcher. What will keep people glued to the game if the game itself isn't terribly exciting? Say it's a blowout?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. But there's just this tiny nugget of news, this dark cloud hovering over possible perfect season for the Patriots. Yesterday Senator Arlen Specter, the Republican of Pennsylvania, wrote to the NFL wanting it to explain why it destroyed videotapes connected to a Patriots cheating scandal back early in the season. What do you know about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I'm trying to understand this. I'm going to search for, say, bass fishing. I'm actually online right now. And I'm going to look at the results that come up. And there are, as you say, a number of ads that, that come up sort of on the right-hand side, trying to direct my attention. How much would an ad like that cost? An ad for fishing gear or travel okay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if you go to Yahoo! 's home site, you'll also see these displays, these banner ads. How much would they cost?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So can Microsoft and Yahoo! partnered ever catch up to Google?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Advertising based on your behavior?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the past week, Barack Obama seems to have really sharpened his criticism about Hillary Clinton in his campaign and his campaign message. What is it that he's saying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Barack Obama goes into Super Tuesday having won a big win in South Carolina. Clinton also won in Florida, didn't pick up delegates but did win there. So who has a sense of momentum right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, if we look at this block of people who voted or caucused for Edwards in these early contests, what kind of demographic profile do we see?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any indication that the voters who are supporting Edwards or who were supporting Edwards were motivated not just by their impression of him but also by their version to one of the other candidates. Is there an anti-Obama or anti-Clinton factor here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, when you actually attended Edwards' rally, some of the biggest applause lines, the moment where the crowd really got fired up, was when he talked about two things: bringing all the troops home within a year and fighting for the middle class. Where do voters, who are fired up when they hear those things, go now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, even as - it stands out now into a national contest, the candidates and the campaigns know quite a lot about voters and their tendencies and the issues that they care about and the candidates that they support. Will the campaigns now aggressively go after the Edwards vote? Will they, you know, specific mailers try to hit them on the phone?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the unions. John Edwards had picked up endorsements from carpenters, steel workers, service employees in Iowa, teachers in South Carolina. What about those voters? Are they free agents now or will the unions re-endorse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Police have just given a briefing. What more--what do we know at this moment about the attacks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do the details that the police have discovered so far about the bombs add up to who might have carried out these attacks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, just also the claim of responsibility from a group calling itself the Secret Group of al-Qaeda's Jihad in Europe. Does that still stand as a claim at least?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about travel cancellations? Has there been enough time to gauge if people are canceling their trips?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How have companies responded to the news at this point in time, British Airways, for instance?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a pattern to how travelers react to terrorist attacks, and some keeping them away and some not keeping them away?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would this bill protect workers' pension benefits?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Requiring employers to put aside enough money to pay their pensions sounds like common sense. But what is the flaw in that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And other than airline workers, who else should be worried then about their pension benefits?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just a last question, how likely is this proposed overhaul of pension insurance to actually make its way into law?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Commentator Douglas Kmiec is chair and professor of constitutional law at Pepperdine University. Tomorrow, another perspective on Justice O'Connor's retirement. You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News. There was some more bad economic news this morning. New home sales fell 26 percent last year; that's the biggest drop on record. Some economists say this is yet another sign the U.S. economy is headed for a recession. But here's a paradox. When the stock market heard the news on housing, it went up. The Dow Jones closed more than 170 points up on the day. NPR's Adam Davidson joins us from New York to make sense of that confusing picture. And, Adam, let's start with something basic. Why is it that new home sales number is so important? How does it affect the rest of us who aren't in the business of selling homes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it's a bad day for Arnold, Betty and Claudio. Why, then, should those investors Durwood(ph) and Eleanor(ph), why would they see the stock market go up in response to the bad news for Arnold, Betty and Claudio?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yes, Ben, of course, is at the Fed, which begins with F. This is a busy week for financial information. Every day we're getting some new data here. What else will we learn this week after the housing numbers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tonight, President Bush delivers his final State of the Union Address. It's a moment that two-term presidents often use to frame their legacies and to rally their supporters. The president is expected to highlight his package of tax rebates and business incentives aimed at jumpstarting the economy. He'll also take aim at congressional earmarks and for more of what he's likely to say, we're joined by NPR's Brian Naylor. Brian, we've been getting some early word about what will be in the president's speech. What else can you tell us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, in terms of the big picture, a theme perhaps, what should we be listening for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Congress takes up the president's economic stimulus package tomorrow and the Senate tellingly sends it to committee. Does that mean that the Senate will not do what the president would like, which is pass it very quickly with no changes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here's a president, though, who has given State of the Union addresses fresh from electoral victories, just a couple of months after 9/11 in one case. This time, he's appearing in the last year of his presidency and not a very popular president. Does he have any political capital left to put behind these ideas of his?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What made George Habash so important?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now as devastating as the lost of the Sisi Palm will be for horticulturalists, it pales with the losses felt now by the French bank, Societe Generale. Bank officials gave new details today about the schemes of a low-level employee who managed to carry out fraudulent trades that cost the bank more than $7 billion. Jerome Kerviel used other people's computer access codes and falsified documents to enter fictitious trades. The bank won't rule out the possibility that he did have accomplices. Kerviel's lawyer says incredibly that his client did not profit from the schemes. Now, let me turn to you, Ron. Is Florida really the make-or-break contest for the Republicans? Is this critical for all of them or just Rudy Giuliani?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Very interesting here. Now, we aren't just talking about Republicans in Florida. Why are we just talking about Republicans in Florida?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I see. Okay. But let's turn then to South Carolina, because the Democrats do have this, you know, make-or-break for some, it would seem contest today. The returns we expect again tonight after the 7 p.m. Eastern time close of the polls. We will report those returns as we get them. But of course, how critical is this, Ron Elving, for the Democrats?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And we should remind listeners that they can learn more about what's at stake in today's Democratic primary in South Carolina and all of these races as - then they can follow results after the polls close tonight at 7.pm. at npr.org/elections. You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. One of the pleasures of winter is strapping blades onto your feet and skating out onto a frozen sheet of ice; the cool puffs of air on your face, the silent joy of gliding, almost frictionless. But have you ever thought about how weird it is? Listen to what I just said, strapping blades onto your feet and skating out onto on a sheet of ice. What human started that behavior? This week in Science Out of the Box, researchers at Oxford University have just released a paper on the origins of ice skating. Federico Formenti is an expert in human locomotion at Oxford University, and he's one of the co-authors of the paper, \"The First Humans Traveling on Ice: An Energy-Saving Strategy?\" He joins us from the studios of the BBC in Oxford. How are you, sir?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, who was it? Who was the first person to strap on the skates and go out onto the ice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Interesting. Finland is a pretty cold place; lots of ice there, so that all seems to make sense to me. But there are lots of cold places. Why Finland?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the archeological evidence show that it's Finland?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of animal bones are the skates made of?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what--you know, question of the hour. What are Lance Armstrong's chances for a seventh Tour win?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There have been some changes on Lance Armstrong's Discovery team. Talk to us about that. Is it a better team?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the route of the Tour de France changes every year. What does it look like this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the key make or break points for the riders?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Whoever wins this year's race, Lance Armstrong has said he'll retire from the competition. Looking ahead, how does the sport of cycling appear without this superstar, I mean, this real superstar of the past several years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, are these delegates pledged to a candidate? I mean, once they say or they're pledged to say Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, is that binding?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm. But if the candidates stay in, you're supposed to stay with whom you signed on with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another layer of complication here is something called the super delegates. Tell us about super delegates. Who are they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if you look at the totals with the super delegates totaled in, Hillary Clinton has a big lead. She has 236 delegates total. Barack Obama has a 152. John Edwards has 50. But if you take away those super delegates, it's a very different story. Barack Obama actually has 38; Clinton behind him with 36; John Edwards with 18. So which number is more meaningful?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, what if we come out of Super Tuesday with just a jumble? What do you see happening then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But Mr. Kibaki is insisting that he is - whether you agree with him or not - the duly elected president of Kenya. What would possibly make him agree to step down or have new elections?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Odinga, you said that Kenya is aflame and there will be no peace. Those words could be interpreted by your followers as essentially license for them to go and keep on with the violence that your country has seen since this elections in December. Why not send a message of this is a time that we need to be looking for peace and putting down our weapons?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Odinga, you know well that the human rights group, Human Rights Watch, has accused your party - the Orange Democratic Movement - of orchestrating attacks on members of Mr. Kibaki's ethnic group - the Kikuyu. They say the attacks were not spontaneous, that they were planned, they were incited by opposition leaders. What do you say to that accusation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I'm not. So you'll have to describe it for us. Just how cold is the South?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, I was thinking about how cold your hands get when you're out in the cold. How do you keep your hands warm right now, since you're holding on to that pole?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you're down there with the National Science Foundation. What kind of science goes on at the pole?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I understand that it's very rare that such a large chunk of the wireless spectrum becomes available for commercial uses, isn't it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the biggest chuck, the one that is national and is going to be used for commercial purposes has attracted all sorts of telecoms giants here, AT&T, Verizon, also Google and other Silicon Valley tech companies. What will they be able to do with this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about cell phones, how can it change the way cell phones work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does that mean allow anyone to connect anything to it, what do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the analog of that might be when my bell was broken up, and suddenly, you could buy a phone at Radio Shack and plug it into the wall and it worked with whatever phone line you had, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds like there's some pretty stiff competition here among the different companies. How much do you think this chunk of the spectrum will go for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But it did come off as questioning his patriotism, didn't it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the title of your book is \"Confessions of a Political Hitman,\" and the word confession kind of suggests regret. Do you have any regrets?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the Bush administration started its first term saying Africa would be a priority. The Millennium Challenge account was part of that effort to help the continent, but almost no money's been distributed. Is this all lip service by the Bush administration in your opinion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, five African presidents who visited President Bush earlier this week said the fine print and the US bureaucracy made it difficult for them to qualify for Millennium Challenge funds. They were complaining about this. Is is that difficult?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have an example that you can give us of a particular country, for instance, that, you know, should be benefiting from this fund but can't somehow get through the hoops?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you make of this sudden resignation of Paul Applegarth, who had headed up the Millennium Challenge and resigned just days after the president spoke with some of the leaders of countries which should benefit from it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Next month President Bush meets with other leaders of the G8 meeting. How much money do you think that they will come up with for Africa, and do you think whatever they come up with will be well spent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Will you talk about that dramatic finish. What is it that makes Pinehurst unique?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Tiger Woods won the Masters in April. So where does that put him coming into this Open?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And last year's champion; not a lot of talk about him, is there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what will you be keeping an eye on over the next couple of days?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does this debt cancellation agreement really get at the problem of poverty in Africa?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I want to understand what you said when you said the prices for Africa's commodities are going down. This is a continent with a lot of oil. We've heard prices are going up. There are diamonds. There are gold. But it doesn't average out for the Africans?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does this debt cancellation agreement do about that corruption problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This debt cancellation comes after a widespread movement for precisely that. Are there other movements to alleviate other causes of poverty, perhaps more significant causes in your view?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you make of the apparent Clinton victory in the Nevada caucuses?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. Far behind still. Let's turn to the Republicans in Nevada. It seems to have been a cakewalk for Mitt Romney. How big a deal is it for Republicans that they - the other ones that they lost Nevada?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It was sort of fait accompli. How important is having won Nevada for Mitt Romney?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " South Carolina. Democrats go to South Carolina. The polls in South Carolina next Saturday - does the winner in Nevada going to South Carolina with that, you know, the M-word, momentum, that we're always talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And of course, now it's changed a lot. Charleston is now considered one of the most pretty, sort of picture-postcard and livable cities in the country. How much do you take credit for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From reading about your work, I understand that you have a monthly mayor's night in, where you sit in your office and anyone, any citizen can come talk to you. What kind of things do you hear from your citizens then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, of course, there have been challenges in your 32 years. I think of the fire last year that killed nine firefighters, the biggest death of firefighters since 9/11. You've been criticized personally over how you handled this. What are your thoughts now about that time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mayor Riley, are you going to run again?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I gather those prosthetics are known as cheetahs, and Pistorius wanted to start competing against able-bodied athletes. The IAAF, the governing organization of track and field, launched an inquiry, no?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. And the conclusion was that the prosthesis amounted to technical aids for Pistorius and that made him ineligible to try to qualify for the Olympics. Before we go on to some of the issues raised by this, did he actually have a shot at qualifying for the Olympics or doing well there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Today, Fed Chairman Bernanke called for an economic stimulus package. John McCain says cut corporate taxes right away. What do you say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How important is Saturday night to you, by the way, in your campaign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you're among the many millions of people who take drugs to lower cholesterol, you may well be confused by the results of a study of the drugs Zetia and Vytorin. The manufacturers of those drugs have just released data showing that while they do significantly lower the level of bad cholesterol, or LDL, they do not prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries. In fact, the drugs might increase that buildup. So what's a patient to do? Well, we've asked Dr. Stuart Seides to help sort through this. He's associate director of cardiology at the Washington Hospital Center. Dr. Seides, are you getting a lot of calls from your patients today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are you telling your patients who call in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, why use that? These new findings say that, yeah, the drugs do lower cholesterol but its benefit of reducing plaque in the arteries is not holding up. So why wouldn't you take something that might do both?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was the expectation of these two drugs - Vytorin and Zetia - that they would help prevent heart attack strokes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if you know there are drugs out there that do both - that lower cholesterol levels and would decrease the risk of, say, heart attack - why not just prescribe those?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Seides, if this study by the manufacturers, which are Merck and Schering-Plough, was completed about two years ago is just being released now after a lot of pressure from Congress and the media. Do you find that troubling?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why not? Why not sell?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do people even pay attention to those things anymore?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A lot of people at one point or another in their lives get into a good investment, whether it's a stock or real estate. How do you keep yourself from getting too greedy in that situation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Carlos Mesa, the president, he's warned that all of this has added up to placing Bolivia on the brink of civil war. Is it really that bad or is that rhetoric on his part?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the US-backed war on drugs, which is going on there, is that playing a role in this crisis?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how is it likely to be resolved?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So while the media has been focusing on this Michael Jackson thing, what else has been going on in town?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of a town is Santa Maria?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When's the rodeo?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm sorry. Excuse me. You were part of the beard-growing contest?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Tony Blair is pushing climate change at the G8 summit, which is coming up. That's the meeting of eight major world leaders. We know where Tony Blair stands. We know where President Bush stands on global warming at the moment. Where do some of the other six stand?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the connection between these others kinds of savings and changing Social Security?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " At the end of President Bush's speech, he directly addressed Palestinians, Israelis, Iraqis and Iranians in turn. And I wonder, how common is it for people living in the region to hear the entirety of Mr. Bush's speech versus just soundbites in the media?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Bush reiterated that he believes Iran to be the world's leading state sponsor of terror. In contrast, he praised the United Arab Emirates as a model Muslim state and spoke of rallying friends around the world to confront the danger of Iran before it is, quote, \"too late.\" How does it play in the Arab media when President Bush publicly enlists Muslim states like this in a sort of us-against-them scenario?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It comes down to manufacturing, Jepsen says, and economies of scale. If she can contract for five million units a month, for example, rather than 500,000, the cost of each laptop drops dramatically. Jepsen believes that in one year, she can get the price of her laptop down to $75. So does this means she'll now compete with the One Laptop per Child project?"}

But this year, Federer's been battling a stomach ailment and Serena has fallen to number seven in the world tennis rankings, when she used to be number one. What are their chances this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That means that Israel would be eliminating, say, settlements and settlement outposts as an undertaking that Israel is obliged to make regardless of Palestinian progress, say, on achieving security. That's up to them, you're going to take part of your obligations independently or is it conditional upon Palestinian action?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here's a question now about the understandings of what those commitments are. Secretary of State Rice told the Jerusalem Post last night, the United States does make a distinction between settlement activity in East Jerusalem and settlement activity on the West Bank. And Israel's road map obligations, which included building freeze, according to Secretary Rice, relate to settlement activity generally. How can Israel square, say, the expansion of the Har Homa neighborhood of East Jerusalem with a commitment to the road map as other people understand the road map?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But Har Homa is not part of that order. Do I understand that correctly because it's in East Jerusalem, and Israel regards it as separate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How far can this process between Israel and the Palestinians go without your negotiating partners, the Palestinians, having de facto control over the Gaza Strip?"}

Exit polls show voters in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia re-elected their president today. Mikhail Saakashvili is a U.S.-educated lawyer who came to power after the so-called Rose Revolution four years ago. He's tried to push Georgia closer to NATO and the European Union - to the dismay of the country's much bigger neighbor, Russia. NPR's Gregory Feifer is in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, and joins me on the line. Greg, how big a win does this seem to be for Saakashvili?"}

Today, an explosion struck people attending a funeral in Kandahar, Afghanistan. That funeral was for a religious leader who had been assassinated a few days ago. He was a prominent supporter of the new government set up by the United States and he was a prominent critic of the Taliban. New York Times reporter Carlotta Gall is in Afghanistan, has been covering this story. Carlotta, first off, who was this cleric?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " His name was Maulavi Abdullah Fayaz, and how was he killed on Sunday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This assassination came after Maulavi Abdullah Fayaz had made some statements about the Taliban's leader. What did he say?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Carlotta, you've covered countless violent incidents in Afghanistan. It's hard for people here, I think, to keep track of them all.

And, Sylvia, what's been the reaction across Europe to the French vote? SYLVIA POGGIOLI reporting: Well, here's a sampling of headlines describing the result: `A Turning Point for French and European Union History'; `Europe Has Been Brought to a Standstill'; and `A Masochistic Masterpiece.' So at least in the media, the reaction is of dismay and uncertainty over the broader consequences of the first-ever rejection of a European Union treaty by a large founding member of the alliance. And with the likelihood, as we just heard, that Dutch voters will also reject the treaty, there's a widespread sense here that the constitution is dead in the water. Well, what happens now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sylvia, you've been covering this process for years. Why did the French people, as far as you can tell, reject this constitution?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Polish plumber invasion--I guess that's a fear of workers from other countries. Are these kinds of concerns shared by other Europeans?"}

More than 100 people have been killed as police battled protestors in the streets. The fighting has been ignited along tribal lines. Yesterday, the incumbent president of Kenya, Mwai Kibaki, was declared the winner by a slim margin over his rival, opposition leader, Raila Odinga. But Western observers say there is clear evidence of vote rigging. Michael Ranneberger is the U.S. ambassador to Kenya. We've reached him in Nairobi.

North of Baghdad, there were to suicide bombings today, at least 30 people were killed and more than 80 other were wounded. At a patrol base near the city of Iskandariyah, south of Baghdad, soldiers got a short break for a holiday meal inside a former hideout of al-Qaida in Iraq.

According to the Federal Reserve, three out of four households have credit cards. The average household carries balances of over $5,000. And all told, we owe something like $900 billion to the credit card companies. So how are we doing at paying off that debt? Well, that's the question that Associated Press reporter Bob Porterfield set out to answer along with reporter Rachel Konrad. And Bob Porterfield, you found that we're not doing so well?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " There has been a sharp decline in roadside bombings in Iraq. The Bush administration says one reason is that Iran is using its influence to rein in Shiite militias who were planting the bombs. Just a few months ago, American officials were blaming Iran for fomenting violence in Iraq. This new assessment from the State Department was reported in today's Washington Post by Karen DeYoung, and she joins me now. In your article, you quote some very senior U.S. officials. Who were they, and what did they tell you?"}

Now, the State Department says Iran is tamping down violence in Shiite militias in southern Iraq. What's going on here?"}

I think the CNN poll has Hillary Clinton with a big lead over Barack Obama in New Hampshire, whereas the Gallup-USA Today poll has them in dead even. What do you make of all that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, so the Army met its goals. What did it have to do to get there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you know anything about what kinds of crimes they can get waivers for and what crimes they can't?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So while they made their goals for 2007, have they set themselves up for it to be much harder or even fail in 2008?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Something else is interesting is I understand the Army is facing kind of an exodus of captains or what we might call in the private sector middle managers. What's happening there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you talk to people in the Army, especially the career people at the top of their careers, what do they say it means to change the makeup of the Army this way to lower your threshold for recruits, to boost people up to captain level before you might have before.

This week, we went across the street to visit a bat that's taken up residence in a nearby office building. NPR staffers spotted the bat, a few weeks ago, nestled into a crack in the side of the building right next to a busy bus stop. And we were all wondering what was this little bat doing all by itself in downtown Washington, D.C. So I invited bat expert Leslie Sturges just to come have a look at the NPR bat. I have to ask you, is this a very good place for a bat to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is he okay here. So why don't you take a look at him? What kind of bat is this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let me describe it here a little bit more. This bat is so small it's like bigger than a mouse, smaller than a gerbil. It's tucked into this crevice. It looks like it could be dead or something. Do you think it's dead?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mrs. Thompson, I'd like to ask you about your role in the campaign. For a time, the campaign wouldn't openly discuss exactly what your role was. There was a lot of speculation about exactly what role you did play, what you actually did in the campaign. Could you clarify that for us?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And all these were mistakes in your view?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When was the last time you changed your investment strategy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " People will sometimes talk about a buying opportunity. They'll say well, the market went down or this particular sector of the market went down, this is the time to buy. Would you advise just rejecting that and still just re-evaluating your portfolio once a year as you do or occasionally?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what would the compromise be on the Republican side?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've been described as working with Trent Lott, well-known Republican senator, on this. Can you describe how, if at all, you guys have been working together?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you and Senator Lott on the same page on this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've said that you think that most of your colleagues want this problem to go away. Why do you think people want the problem to go away?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are any Republican senators that you know of agreeing with your position, your proposed compromise?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was it understood at the time, because of the ambiguous wording of this agreement, that in the end these countries would become satellite states of a Communist country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does this particular soundbite, if you will, fit in with the president's broader strategy and his broader vision for the world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you make a big philosophical pronouncement about freedom vs. stability, do those things really mean anything when you get down to the case-by-case question of whether you're going to deal with a country, whether you're going to back off dealing with a country?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Isn't Annika Sorenstam the one who created such a stir two years ago by playing in a PGA Tour event?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But then why isn't she, in a way, not better-known?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, does it come down, though, in the end, to her winning, that is, can she keep winning, and will that be good enough?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, you just said, though, that to really be effective, there would need to be 50,000 troops from somewhere. That is an enormous number of troops. I mean, there's less than half that amount in Afghanistan. Realistically, who would be offering to provide those troops initially?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Turning to another area of possible action, there have been calls for the US to enforce sanctions in the oil sector in Sudan. Pakistan, China and Russian all have major investments there. Have these countries played a role in blocking stronger Security Council action that might have brought about sanctions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another suggestion would be a no-fly zone to stop Sudan's army from sending in planes to attack villages or cover for the attackers on the ground. Where does that stand?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You say you're an ethanol plant investor, tell me about that. What have you invested in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you been watching closely what's been happening with the energy bill here in Washington? If I were to go to the local diner there in Pomeroy or head to the feed store, what might I hear from others about this bill?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " about this and I imagine in, you know, two different ways. As a farmer, you know, this is good news, but as an investor, are there also questions about whether corn is really the most efficient way to make alternative fuels that perhaps it's better to look at other sources?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk first about the oil resources that are at stake here. How much oil in the province of Kirkuk?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And for the central government in Baghdad, how would they see Kirkuk?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do you see a way out of that impasse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How delicate a balance do you think there is right now in Kirkuk? With this referendum on hold, progress seeming to come slowly, if at all. What could happen? What's the worst scenario there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A new kind of coal-fired power plant meant to help decrease global warming is taking a step forward today. A consortium of coal companies and utilities has announced it will build its future gen power plant in Mattoon, Illinois. Mattoon beat out other towns in Illinois and Texas as home for the $1.8 billion facility. As the plant generates power rather than shooting carbon dioxide into the air, it will pump it deep into the ground. Matthew Wald of the New York Times is here to talk about how it'll work. And, Matt, what's the process?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And dispose of, they're saying, by putting it under the ground. How is that going to work? How is this carbon capture going to work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Theoretically?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's a pretty expensive test. $1.8 billion to figure out if this is going to work?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " The New York Times' Matt Wald. In addition to the Des Moines Register, John McCain also now holds a couple of other endorsements from the Boston Globe yesterday and, today, from Senator Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut independent. With 17 days to go before the caucuses in Iowa and 22 days before the New Hampshire primary, we've brought in NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson to talk about what it all might mean. And first, Mara, let's talk about Hillary Clinton and the Des Moines Register endorsement. What might that mean for her and what are the polls saying about how she's doing there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk also about John McCain - also got the endorsement of the Des Moines Register in a state where he's not thought to be especially competitive. What might that endorsement mean for him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. Remind us, Mara, this - this campaign, John McCain's campaign was considered to be in deep, deep trouble not too long ago, what's happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So exactly how would this legislation change the procedures that are now followed by the State Department?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Congressman Blumenauer, there are security risks with letting people in. What provisions does this bill make for screening people, if any?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These provisions are in an authorization bill that - you know, it authorizes the Department of Defense and all the programs that go along with it, but it doesn't fund them. Are you worried that these things will not be funded adequately later?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another issue. In an interview on Fox News recently, you said that the government should not be bailing out people whose mortgages are about to reset to interest rates that they can't afford. Foreclosures are at record rates right now. And wouldn't doing nothing \u2014 as millions of Americans risk losing their homes \u2014 wouldn't that smack of Herbert Hoover deferring to the market as 25 percent of Americans were unemployed in the Depression?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But apart from assigning a kind of an ethical or moral responsibility to the players in this problem, where does the government step in? What's the role of the federal government? And if you were president and this crisis were deepening, what would be the role of the Huckabee administration in approaching it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But there's a different degree of danger in somebody who takes the risk to drive 95 miles an hour on icy roads and somebody who notices that real estate prices are going up all around them and buys a house one size too big. To your mind, moral hazard is still at work, you don't want to encourage that kind of decision?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I will go on to another subject, which comes in The New York Times profile; it's going to be published on Sunday. In that, you made a remark - that you've been asked about a great deal and you've already apologized for \u2014 about the Mormon faith. You asked, isn't it true that Mormons believe that the devil was Jesus' brother or something like that. I gather that you apologized to Governor Romney for it. It raises a question for many people. Are you ready for primetime? Are you ready for the scrutiny of everything that you say, and every remark that you made or have made that will now be subject to the microscope of national political coverage?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you feel that you're getting an unfair shake here about being a Baptist minister, and that people are going after your beliefs more than is appropriate in a presidential campaign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are those people giving you money now? Are you actually raising some money for this campaign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much money have you raised in this quarter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me read to you the beginning of the Fed statement today announcing its quarter point cut. Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. For people who read Fed statements every month, how does that read to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why, after a quarter point cut, if one can ever explain why markets do things, why would the stock market plunge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, whenever the Fed reduces interest rates, it's trying to make money move faster through the economy, get more money out there, and then there's a fear that it might increase inflation. What does the Fed said about inflation this time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Of course, what we've all been watching is which interest rate and by how much will it go down or not. But the interest rate now is - it's at 4.25 percent. Historically, what does that say - the federal fund's rate at 4.25 percent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any end in sight to that as far as the Fed is concerned?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel. From Oklahoma to Wisconsin, trees are down, power is out, schools were closed and at least 23 people have died all because of a massive ice storm.

NPR's Jason Beaubien has been in the middle of all these, driving from Kansas through Missouri and then to Oklahoma where a federal emergency has been declared. He's now in Tulsa. Jason, what have you seen?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " The communication intercepts that you mentioned - according to some reports, they were conversations that referred to the program having been stopped in 2003, which, of course, raises the question about how anyone would know that that's not disinformation. How do you judge an intercept to know whether what the person is saying is actually true or designed to steer you off track?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much of this do you think may have been a result of them going back to the very same information they had in 2005, with fresh eyes, with a new way of looking at the same stuff they had before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mark, when you read through the NIE, you'll see terms used like high confidence, moderate confidence - these have very specific meanings, but to a layperson mean really not much at all. Can you explain what the distinctions are?"}

You're in the last days of your final tour there, and there must be a time where you're taking stock of everything what you're seeing in that time. And what's changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jamie, when you think about the four and a half years that you've been in Baghdad, do you see a curve, a pattern of what's happened in that time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you think of something you've seen or heard that, especially prompt you to feel as pessimistic as you do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm. On the flipside of that pessimism that you were talking about -I mean, is there some thing you have seen, someone you've met that has made you think, you know, maybe there is a chance that this country will pull itself together and has a future?"}

NPR's Mike Shuster has been covering the Iran nuclear story for many years. He joins us to try to separate fact from spin. And, Mike, first, the president made a lot of assertions today that this National Intelligence Estimate validates his policy of rallying international pressure to change Iran's behavior. How does that square with the public record?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you're saying that was triggered by the discussions with the European Union, not with the United States?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mike, what about the assertion in the NIE that it was international pressure that caused Iran to halt its nuclear weapons program back in 2003? What international program are these analysts talking about?"}

Doesn't that imply that there's some real problem with how much you can depend on them and how their allegiances might sway?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " General Petraeus, as you start reducing U.S. troop levels in Iraq and given the uneven performance of the Iraqi forces and Iraqi police, how worried are you about security gaps that either al-Qaida in Iraq or Shiite militias might very handily exploit?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Nancy Miller, a day after the NBC deal was announced, TiVo struck deals with companies called Carat, another one called Nero. All of this seems to require the massive collection of data on viewers. And what does this mean that TiVo, for example, knows about us?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " First question, Carl Zimmer. Going back to the father of taxonomy, also your namesake Carl Linnaeus, he classified life by looking at the structures that life forms have, you know, arms, arm bones, all through the animal kingdom and so on. But that was 300 years ago. Nowadays, we can observe living things on the molecular level. How has this changed our taxonomy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. I think the map that I'm looking at is the Carl Woese map of life. Can you outline for us what Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya are?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It took a while to gain acceptance in the scientific community. Does everyone accept it now?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what would you have India do to turn this brain drain around?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're saying the U.S. doesn't have enough doctors from the United States itself. Is that a fault of not having enough medical schools, though, or is there just simply not, a big enough pool of people who say, I want to go into medicine, I want to be a doctor?"}

The stock market is on a seesaw again this week. And after a 200-point loss in the Dow yesterday, the mood on Wall Street shifted today. The Dow finished up more than 200 points. The turnaround came after a big drop in oil prices. It also followed news that an Abu Dhabi investment group is buying a big chunk of Citigroup, which has been hit hard by the mortgage crisis. NPR's Jim Zarroli has been following the story. He joins us from New York. And Jim, tell us about this deal that involves Citigroup and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. What's it about?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sometime soon, sometime on or after November 29th, Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein will likely have his day in an Iraqi court. That may sound vague but so is much else in the case of Bilal Hussein. He is an Iraqi national, a native of the city of Fallujah, who took pictures of the fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents and of the consequences of that fighting. In April 2006, he was arrested in the Iraqi city of Ramadi. The U.S. military never made public a detailed case against him, but claimed that Bilal Hussein was a terrorist who had infiltrated the AP that he was in possession of bombs and well acquainted with bomb makers. The U.S. has detained him ever since. The Associated Press, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of Iraq - coverage that included Bilal Hussein's photography - has conducted a report on the case and concluded that the charges are either false or meaningless. Tom Curley is president and CEO of the Associated Press and joins us from our bureau in New York City. Mr. Curley, first of all, do you know what Bilal Hussein is to be charged with or when he will learn those charges?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A public affairs officer for U.S. forces in Iraq told us last week Bilal Hussein was initially detained in 2006 for possessing within his home improvised explosive device materials, insurgent propaganda and a surveillance photo of a coalition force installation. What did your report find and how did it answer those charges?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He was accused, more or less, of being unnaturally well wired and plugged into insurgent forces in Ramadi where he was arrested. Is it possible that he was sympathetic to them or in some way working for them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about that charge that one of them amounted to a surveillance photo of a coalition force installation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is at least one photograph he took where we see insurgents at their weapons. It would appear to be that they're engaged in combat. Is he behind their lines? Is he with them at that moment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If, in fact, there's nothing to the case that he was someway in league with the insurgents and that he was in possession of some materials that might be used to make explosives, why do you think U.S. forces - or for that matter now, the Iraqi courts - are so interested in him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How well do you know Bilal Hussein? You've picked him up in Iraq a couple of years ago. He was often in these cities. Did people at the AP bureau in Baghdad know him well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've had some questions answered - not in great detail - by the public affairs office here in Iraq. What have you heard from either the U.S. military or from the administration, for that matter - the Department of Defense?

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Miller, this conflict goes back even before the creation of the state of Israel. But the Six-Day War in 1967 and the Israel's capture of Arab lands really gave urgency to the conflict. What was the first major U.S. attempt to broker peace?"}

The Explorer was designed nearly 40 years ago, specifically to move through ice. It was the first ship to take regular folks - non-scientists - through the Northwest Passage and to explore the marvels of Antarctica. It was there in the cold, cold waters of Antarctica that the Explorer met its end on Friday. Ice smashed a hole in its hull, sending all 154 passengers and crew members to their lifeboats. They bobbed there in the cold water for a couple of hours until rescuers arrived. One of the rescuers was a National Geographic research cruise ship called the Endeavor.

The Bills' coach said after the game, we ran into a buzz saw. Well, some are saying that New England is revving that buzz saw when it might be more sportsmanlike to turn it down. To talk about that, we're joined by ESPN columnist Bill Simmons. And Bill, in the interest of full disclosure, fair to say you are a Patriots fan, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. Well, taking that into account, let's talk about last night's game. Twice in the third quarter, the Patriots went for it on a fourth down rather than trying for a field goal when they were ahead by an enormous margin. Do you think they're just rubbing it in at that point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's your prediction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're talking about when the Patriots were caught videotaping signals from the Jets and were punished by the NFL?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm, what about this? That the New England coach, Bill Belichick, didn't put in the backup quarterback until the fourth quarter when the score was 56 to 10. Now, at that point, as a Patriots fan, aren't you feeling a little uncomfortable?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Bill, because the Patriots seem unstoppable and they're getting all these lopsided wins, does the team become, for a lot of people really, a villain?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Don't you think it's undeserved in the case of the Patriots?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's ESPN columnist Bill Simmons. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Andrea Seabrook. The political turmoil in Pakistan is riveting the world's attention not just because Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has been an ally in the U.S. war on Islamist militants, it's also a great source of concern because Pakistan has nuclear weapons that could potentially fall into the wrong hands. Today, the New York Times reports that the U.S. has been secretly helping Pakistan safeguard its nuclear arsenal. One of the reporters on that story is David Sanger and he joins me now. David Sanger, how exactly has the U.S. helped Pakistan guard its nuclear arms?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that prohibits countries from sharing actual nuclear technology and it's that that the U.S. is trying to work around, isn't that right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think the Bush administration wants people to know about this now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Pumpkin pie would be nothing if it weren't for the nutmeg, the cinnamon and the cloves. This classic of Thanksgiving, of Americana even, owes its very existence to a long history of travel, adventure, murder and intrigue along the spice route. So we invited spice historian Jack Turner to help us deconstruct our Thanksgiving table. He is the author of \"Spice: The History of a Temptation.\" And he joins me now by phone from his home in Geneva. Mr. Turner, how are you, sir?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how do we go from that early history to our own table today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jack Turner, did the early Americans - did the Pilgrims have spices? Do they know about them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Brace yourself. Over the next five weeks, you'll face a barrage of Christmas music. The assault begins with television commercials, follows you to the malls and builds to a full choir standing right outside your door. But before those bells jingle you into a fit, there's another batch of holiday songs to consider: Thanksgiving songs. Thanksgiving songs, you might ask? Well, Allyson Ledoux knows them well. She teaches them every year to children. She is the 2006 Vermont Music Educator of the Year. Hello. How are you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's the other song?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you mind singing a few of the verses to \"Over the River and Through the Woods\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which songs do the kids like at Thanksgiving?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me start by asking you what Pakistanis can see and read now since emergency rule was passed? What information are they getting and how?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sir, I think you just said that these stations that are on the air signed the code of conduct. What is that code of conduct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Guilty of what, sir? What are they not allowed to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are the channels allowed to criticize President Musharraf?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did your channel, ARY One World Television, did it sign the pledge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is that why your channel and GEO TV, the biggest Urdu television service, is that why they were forced to broadcast from outside of Pakistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Abbas, you were also the head of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists. And I'd like to ask you for a little bit of historical perspective, how much freedom did the press have under Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif? Those two are trying to make a comeback now. Any reason to believe it would be more free under them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand, sir, you're receiving an award for press freedom from the Committee To Protect Journalists. For what, exactly, are you receiving that award?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So this mullah, how many fighters does he have? How entrenched are they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Philip, you mentioned Benazir Bhutto pushing on Musharraf on these tribal regions. How does this army operation in the Swat Valley fit into the picture of the current political turmoil in Pakistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We reached Vince Edwards of World Vision in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Jerome, can you just sum up the main points of the report by the panel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Melting glaciers will trigger mountain floods and lead to water shortages in Southeast Asia and South America. Rising sea levels could inundate small-island developing states, reduce the rain fall, will aggravate water and food insecurity in Africa. Jerome, that sounds pretty dire. Did the panel make any recommendations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what happens now? Where does the report go next?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, so you spoke with some of the leaders of the charities who are getting these checks. What was their reaction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the donor is a great mystery still. Does anyone know his or her identity?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Huh. Well, who did we think it was?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is he from Erie or something?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would your bill, that would bring these contractors under U.S. civilian law, would it apply retroactively though, would it apply, say, to the Blackwater shooting back in September?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think they'll do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you've been on the run since police tried to place you under house arrest. How have you managed to elude authorities over the past week? And what happens if you lead this protest, if you show your face, take to the streets?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Musharraf has set a date for elections next year. What are your political plans? Do you plan to run?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I just wanted to - before I really go, I want to give you an opportunity to answer your critics, because some are saying that what you're really trying to do is raise your own profile, that you're more interested in your personal gain than in the country's political future. And some newspapers have actually asked the question, what does Imran want. What do you say to those critics?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you interested in national, political leadership in Pakistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And just one last question before I let you go, sir. What role could or should the U.S. play in trying to quell this conflict?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now that you've won the Nobel Peace Prize, what impact do you think that's had on your work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. What do you say to the critics who say that your work on climate change, on global warming, doesn't really fit under the rubric of world peace? And that the Nobel Peace Prize has become too politicized?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said you wouldn't rule it out in the future. You don't think it's likely. If you think about the 2008 presidential election coming up, why not -if you're not interested in running - why not do what you did before the 2004 election and come right out and say, I'm not a candidate? I'm not in this race?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So here it is, just in time for the holidays, a march towards a $100 a barrel. What's pushing it so high?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, it might have some psychological significance, but it seems to me that people were wincing some while ago. Are oil prices really hurting us? Or we'll just absorb this as a normal course of business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Uri, if the high prices haven't yet had a major effect on the economy, what's the most profound effect globally of $100-a-barrel oil?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you're going to be looking at this on the business desk this week on a couple of our shows. What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk a little bit about \"Crawfish Mountain.\" I'd like to know something about the story. Can you introduce it to us and then maybe read us a little something?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In all seriousness, you've done extensive reporting in your years at the Wall Street Journal - never mind the editorial page. You wrote a very big piece just a couple of years ago about the effects of oil exploration on the Bayou. Tell us a little bit about it. First of all, is it called the Cajun glades or is that a term you invented?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Given that that is all very, very serious, why did you decide to turn this novel into a comic romp?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I have to say, I could hear you laughing out loud describing some of this. Governor Joe T. Evangeline is set adrift in a little pea rowboat, trying to catch red fish, wondering why in this most red fish-loving of all states, he knows nothing about catching one. The Pitres becomes fugitive. The evildoer Tom Huff falls for a woman named Daisy who won't take off her girdle. Do people really say things kind of sounds(ph)like he's been on my back like a second-week case of mange?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With all these different plot lines, does it turn out well in the end? Do they save the marshes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. So is it a voluntary thing that the cat does? If I'm petting the cat in my lap, does it - he decides to start purring or is it an automatic reaction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, could you tell me this? How is it that Eartha Kitt purrs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One other question. Your name is Leslie Lyons, do you get some ribbing about your name?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do you share Chairman - well, for that matter, do the people you're rubbing shoulders with this week share Ben Bernanke's confidence in the resilience of the U.S. economy as opposed to in likelihood of a recession?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But to what degree does the prospect of a housing slump, meaning that lots of people who have felt buoyant about their position in the economy because they expected there has to appreciate in value every year, are feeling a lot less buoyant and unable to borrow against it as much?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it an unmitigated bad for the U.S. or is there some silver lining to the weak dollar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is - and do you share any of the concern which Chairman Bernanke evidently doesn't, that if the dollar weakens too much, say China, which holds our debt, might decide to diversify a bit more and, say, hold more Euros?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, there's rule of law but there's also respect, which authority really relies on - holding onto the respect of the people. And are you concerned that this will undermine his authority in the long run?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I know your time is very tight, so sorry. I just have one last question. How long do you expect President Pervez Musharraf to impose this emergency state?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " a timeframe, though? How long do we expect the state of emergency?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Weeks, months?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I want to ask you about actually what's going on on the ground in Pakistan. Help us understand what's motivating the lawyers. Are they upset primarily by the sacking of Judge Chaudhry or the imposition of emergency rule, or was this perhaps a match that's sparked an underlying anger that had already been simmering?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, lawyers have taken to the streets all over the country. There've been clashes between police and lawyers in several places - Peshawar, Lahore, Malton. I'm just curious that the lawyers are organized or coordinated in their opposition or this is more of a spontaneous action breaking out all over the country all at once?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you been able to keep in contact with her?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When do you expect to go back to Pakistan and what do you expect to find?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've given no thought of staying in London?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The novel is \"Tokyo Year Zero\" by David Peace. Alan Cheuse teaches writings at George Mason University. And our book coverage continues online. There you'll find a new installment of our series, You Must Read This, author Maile Meloy on the novel \"The Cloud Atlas.\" That's at NPR.org. This is NPR. National Public Radio. For NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris. The trial of an American soldier charged with murdering three Iraqis and then lying about their deaths began today on a U.S. military base in Baghdad. Staff Sergeant Michael Hensley is part of an Army sniper unit. His team is accused of baiting Iraqis with bomb-making materials and killing them when they picked up the explosives. NPR's Jamie Tarabay was at the court proceedings today. She joins us now. Jamie, what can you tell us about the trial so far?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And could you spell out for us exactly what he's charged with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The U.S. military prosecutors assert that Michael Hensley alone was responsible for ordering these killings? It appears they want the investigation to end there. What did the defense attorneys have to say about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is he there for the proceedings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, two other soldiers have also been accused along with Hensley. What can you tell us about them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Hensley, as you said, is accused of baiting Iraqis with these bomb-making materials and then killing them when they picked up the explosives. There's a lot of controversy about the so-called baiting program. The Pentagon is refusing to even admit that it exists. But at least one soldier has talked about it in a sworn statement. What does that statement say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " General Musharraf's gave, as a reason for emergency rule, the fact that the Supreme Court has released 61 suspected terrorists. Isn't this a concern?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wasn't there, however, a concern that perhaps the court might be too lenient on counterterrorism?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you think that that is a fairly tepid response?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have any plans to try to return again to Pakistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The brink of disaster, you say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's set the scene of this new novel, \"A Free Life.\" Its main protagonist is Nan Wu, a young man who flees the communists and comes to America in the mid-1980s to study political science. Tell us a little bit more about Nan Wu, and how are his struggles American struggles?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You left behind a former self. You were a soldier for the People's Liberation Army, and Chinese Cultural Revolution deprived you of gaining literacy and fluency even in your own language when you might have expected it. I mean, you didn't become literate even in Chinese, I understand, until you were in your late teens. How did you make that happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which American literary character does Nan Wu most resemble for you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did you take Nan Wu back to China when you, yourself, Ha Jin, haven't gone back to China?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But there's an entire collection of poetry that gives us an insight into all the things that maybe Nan Wu have on his mind but couldn't articulate, couldn't open up to. And now he's really free because he is liberated to at least inhabit these emotions and feelings. And I thought to myself, I know this book took you a long time. And it's a huge book, 660 pages, but writing all these poems, which you wrote, had to be like writing a second book?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you perhaps like to leave us with reading one of these poems?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Secretary Rice called the declaration of the state of emergency in Pakistan, highly regrettable. A State Department notice said that the United States is deeply disturbed, and the White House has called it very disappointing. So in diplomatic jargon, how severe are these comments?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Obviously, it didn't work. What does today's declaration of a state of emergency in Pakistan mean for the future of U.S.-Pakistani relations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if the United States can't cling to the notion that they're going to the upcoming elections in Pakistan, what can it do? Does it have any choice other than to work with Pervez Musharraf as (unintelligible)?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about terrorism within Pakistan? Have been escalation in bombings there? Does the state of emergency give Musharraf a freer hand, if you will, to deal with al-Qaida or Taliban forces reportedly in the mountain bases there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Professor Rejali, I've read that American troops used simulated drowning in the Philippines at the end of the 19th century after the Spanish-American War. So I'm talking about the years 1902 to 1905. U.S. forces were trying to put down an insurgency in the Philippines. What exactly did they do vis-a-vis water techniques?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So was it called torture?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Didn't court-martials arise from this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " After these cases around the turn of the century, was the practice of waterboarding ever used by American interrogators again?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Allied troops were tortured by the Japanese during World War II. Did the Japanese practice a form of waterboarding, and did the U.S. government considered this torture?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm. Of all the techniques that U.S. interrogators have used on terrorism suspects since September 11, 2001, why do you think waterboarding has been singled out for such attention?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would the Senate amendment declares the Revolutionary Guard to be a terrorist organization? How is that seen within Iran? Is it seen as a first step on a path to war?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How so?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hypothetically, of course, how would you expect the Iranian military to react if there were an attack, say, on Revolutionary Guard facilities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you remember when you were telling him there's nothing normal about this, do you remember feeling satisfied with that answer as a psychologist?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you ultimately get her out of the stall and you get her gun. What could you do for her when you were there in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have any idea what happened to her?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You would have moments in the hospital of patients actually, in some way, taking care of you. You write about a story that's related to you about a triple amputee who's telling jokes from his gurney and when he's medevaced out, using his one arm to give a thumbs up, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How frightening was that to come to that point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how do you get past that? Does it just take time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who were the main contractors who were supposed to be doing this work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mosul, while it's hardly been immune to violence in the war in Iraq, is not like Baghdad. It's in a relatively safer north. Has the project been plagued by terrorism or sabotage of any sort?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did they make any assertions to explain why the work wasn't done?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which government are we talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your office has released another quarterly report on Iraq Reconstruction. Is the story of the dam would you say it's atypical? It's the rare rotten apple in the barrel or that the barrel has too many bad apples in it still?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it at pre-war levels yet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any progress on water?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, maybe those, especially that last one, are just too scary. You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Now, an update on a story we've been following for the last couple of weeks: tensions between two nations of strategic importance to the United States - Turkey and Iraq. Those tensions have been building as Kurdish guerrillas mount increasingly deadly attacks on Turkish soldiers and civilians. Those guerrillas, known as the PKK, shelter on the Iraqi side of the border. And Turkey has been warning it may have to send troops across that border in pursuit. Today, the Turkish Army launched a major operation against Kurdish guerrillas inside Turkey, and according to Turkish news reports, the soldiers killed at least 15 PKK fighters. NPR's Ivan Watson is reporting on the situation today from the Iraqi side of the border. We caught up with him in Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan. Ivan, we just want to make it clear. Today's action by the Turkish military is not near the Iraqi border. What happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do these events have any bearing on the tensions between Turkey and Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ivan let's go back to where you are in northern Iraq, which is that autonomous area for Iraqi Kurds. The Turkish government is demanding that Iraqi Kurds root out the guerillas. How are the Iraqi Kurds responding to those demands?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what do the Iraqi Kurds think should be done?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell me about this garbage patch. Is all this trash just floating on the surface there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. So what does it look like as you're traveling through it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it mostly marine debris or what else do you see?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any one sort of thing that you see? Is it mostly plastic bottles or is it mostly grocery bags?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And why does it all collect there together in this one giant patch?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If it's all conglomerating in these places, why can't you just sort of sweep through and scoop it up and get rid of it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. So you're in a meeting, or maybe it's a first date and you passed by a mirror, check yourself out. And you discover a poppy seed lodged, smacked between your front teeth. Okay, maybe it's a bit of parsley. Whatever it is, you do anything at that moment for a simple toothpick. This little, three-inch stick of wood has saved millions from countless embarrassments. Not to mention decorating the martinis of America's most fashionable. And now, there is a book about it. Historian and engineer Henry Petroski is the author and he joins me here in the studio. How are you, Mr. Petroski?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your book is called \"The Toothpick: Technology and Culture.\" It is 420 pages long with a ton of footnotes about the toothpick?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. So tell me how the standard average wooden toothpick that we all know and love, where did that start out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did he do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Petroski, you've written many books about design. You've explored bridges, the pencil, telephone keypad and, now, the toothpick. What do you look for in a subject when you're going to write a book?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Petroski, have all simple things been invented already?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How long?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What were you thinking?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This weekend, Libya opened peace talks in hope of ending the carnage in Sudan's Darfur region. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese civilians have been killed, millions more displaced. The fighting is largely split along ethnic lines. It involves the Sudanese Army and its Arab militia allies and various black African groups. Today, the Sudanese government quickly proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire, something it's done before. But two of Darfur's main rebel groups are boycotting the conference and that casts doubt on prospects for success. NPR's Gwen Thompkins is at the conference in the Libyan city of Sirte, and she joins me now. Gwen, how significant is the cease-fire declaration by Sudan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Gwen, why are these rebel groups boycotting? And who is there besides the Sudanese government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Gwen, who is there besides the Sudanese government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Time now for Science Out of the Box, our weekly segment when we try to answer our question of basic science and learn about the basic work of scientists. This week, with the World Series resuming tonight in the Mile High City of Denver, our question is about baseball. If you watched tonight's game, you're going to hear a lot about a humidor, and not because they're smoking cigars up in the sky boxes. This is a climate-controlled vault where the Colorado Rockies store their baseballs to keep them as moist as they would be in a more humid climate. Alan Nathan is a professor of physics at the University of Illinois, and he's an expert in the physics of baseball, particularly as played by the Boston Red Sox. Professor Nathan, how much does a baseball dry out in a dry climate like Denver's?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how does that affect the game?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does the coefficient of restitution, the bounciness, mean for the actual game?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the fact that the air through which the ball is flying is dry in Denver? How does that affect the speed or the trajectory or whatever?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Right. Because there'd be less drag on the ball because the air is less dense, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's the altitude, though, don't you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds like a sports fan's dream if you're from Boston. What's the mood around the city?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Sullivan, are there people who hate the Red Sox in Boston?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I can't even imagine. Can you put your finger on why this is all happening right now, and what is this kismet, this synergy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you're the sports editor of the Boston Globe, and you must be very busy these days. How do you choose what to lead with here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happened there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you're saying humans need to act more like dogs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's going on there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you do with the billionaire who can't walk his Chihuahua?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think we turn to dogs to fulfill ourselves?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A dog?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you know anything about them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell anything about people from the fact that they like cats?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And let's start with Fenway Park. The World Series started there. What are its most distinctive features and how they affect the play?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does that altitude affect pitching?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the Rockies had a lot of trouble in Fenway Park. They lost the first two games. What do you think it looks like for the games coming up in Coors Field?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You say you have no intention of taking on the Iraq supplemental this year, why not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if indeed the president heeds your warning, what would be a sufficient change in policy or strategy to warrant approval of more money?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Pay for it by means you proposed if the war in Iraq is to continue, is it a 15 percent tax surcharge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Assuming that such a thing could be passed, how much would it bring in a year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how many homeowners in Southern California do you think are likely to be making claims after this fires and are they all insured?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yes, having been through it before, I would've assumed that people's rates would have gone up after 2003. Did insurance get more expensive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm curious. You're following these fires as someone in the insurance industry with an actuarial eye and it doesn't come out as big as 2003. And we heard so many people saying, worst fire ever. This is the worst we've ever seen. Where does that perception come from if the raw numbers that you're seeing just don't add up that way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when they stopped you, Ivan, what happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. Ivan, how much support would there be for the PKK among the Kurds who live in southeastern Turkey where you are now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ivan, you've spent time on both sides of that border. Can you help us understand if the Turkish forces were to invade, were to go into Iraq, what would they face as they try to root out the PKK?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " 00 - maybe 11:30. And... This is last night?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many people and other animals, would you say, are there at the shelter in Encinitas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Republican presidential candidate Duncan Hunter, speaking last Friday in Washington, D.C. We'll be hearing stump speeches from various candidates over the course of the campaign. Several fires continue to rage out of control across Southern California tonight. More than half a dozen of them in San Diego County alone. Nearly a quarter of a million San Diego residents have fled their homes, and the city is called to duty every able bodied member of its police and fire departments. California Fire Captain Julie Hutchinson is at the site of the Harris Fire, the first of these San Diego blazes. And she joins us now. Captain Hutchinson, where is this Harris Fire and just how close is it to the residential area of San Diego?"}

His latest work of fiction is called \"The Fires.\" From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Andrea Seabrook. Kurdish guerrillas killed at least 17 Turkish soldiers in southeastern Turkey today. It was the single deadliest clash in years between the Turkish army and the rebels who are based in northern Iraq. The ambush sent the Turkish government into crisis talks and all these could complicate the U.S. war in Iraq. More on that in a moment. We begin with NPR's Ivan Watson in Istanbul. Ivan, tell me about the ambush. What happened?"}

And Dr. Aliriza, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates met with Turkey's defense minister today. They were both in Ukraine. The Turkish minister was talking about a possible Turkish response to the guerrilla attacks and he said, we'd like to do these things with the Americans. What did he mean by that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is an incredibly complicated political situation - what with the U.S. operations in Iraq, the Kurds in the north of Iraq are allies of U.S. forces, so are the Turks. What can the U.S. do about these Kurdish guerrilla attacks in northern Iraq beyond just condemning them as President Bush did today or calling them unacceptable as he did today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, at the same time, a committee in the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution that called the killing of Armenians in Ottoman, Turkey early in the 20th century - genocide. Turkey was very upset about this, obviously. Is what happening now mixed up in that resolution in the House of Representatives?"}

These tiny critters break free from their shells, dig away their way out of the sand, and make a mad dash on little tiny flippers to the ocean. And then they disappear from view. Several years later, the sea turtles show up again in shallow waters. Until recently, much of the green turtle's life remained a mystery to humans. This week in Science Out of the Box, we'll find out how researchers are solving that mystery. Karen Bjorndal is the director of the Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research at the University of Florida, one of three researchers who's looked into the question of this creature's lost years. Dr. Bjorndal, you've described the green sea turtle as the species with a cryptic life stage. What is that?"}

Democrats on Capitol Hill demanded to see the memos, but the administration refused to provide them, insisting once again that the U.S. does not engage in torture. As Congress and the White House tussle over the treatment of terror suspects, scholars are gathering in Washington to propose changes to the international laws of war.

In the past, the Kingdom has supported thousands of schools throughout the Islamic world.

This is an Iranian holocaust drama in which the hero is a kind of Persian Schindler, an Iranian Muslim student named Habib Parsa, who obtains documents for the family of Sara Stroke, the Jewish woman he loves. With those documents, they can escape to Tehran. Or can they? You can watch this series with subtitles on YouTube. Farnaz Fassihi, who writes for the Wall Street Journal, watched it recently in Tehran and wrote about it, and she's now back home in Beirut. What's going on here? A Jewish holocaust drama on Iranian television?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Iran still has a Jewish community of 25,000. That's a lot smaller than it was before the Islamic revolution or for that matter, before the creation of the State of Israel. The message that seems to be coming out of this series is Jews are well regarded. How does this very ant-Israel country, or government at least, deal with the issue of Zionism in this series?"}

Sylvia, what effect did those fires and those deaths and the government's action or the lack of it have on the election, do you think?"}

One of those towns is Stockton, about an hour and a half east of San Francisco. Just two years ago, the housing market was hot, fueled by homebuyers looking for affordable housing beyond the pricy San Francisco Bay market. According to the housing data firm, RealtyTrac, Stockton now has the highest foreclosure rate in the country. Art Godi is a longtime realtor in Stockton and a former president of the National Association of Realtors. He joins us now from San Francisco.

The report finds that the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is not only failing to stop officials from committing crimes, it's hindering its own watchdog agency from conducting investigations. NPR's Corey Flintoff, who has read the draft report, joins us now from Baghdad. Hello, Corey. Can you give us a little background on this report? Who produced it?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " But Secretary Paulson, 80,000 sounds a very small number set against the figures we hear of one to two million troubled loans over the next year or two. What to you is a measure of success? How many troubled borrowers get helped and avoid foreclosure for you to say, we did it, we succeeded?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Americans have become accustomed in recent years to borrowing against the appreciation of their homes through equity access loans, to make a lot of purchases. Should that form of borrowing continue or expand, or does it ultimately stake too much of our economic growth and rising real estate values?"}

Britain's foreign secretary and defense secretary write about the pullback from Basra in today's Washington Post and they put the question - the question some people have asked us is have British forces failed in Basra? The answer is no. On the other hand, we've heard from the Americans such as Gen. Jack Keane, the retired general, that as the Brits started to reduce their forces, Shia militias started to flex their muscles, and what was once a relatively stable situation is now deteriorating. Is it deteriorating?"}

From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. Iraqi Shiite leader Moqtada al-Sadr has ordered his powerful Mahdi Army militia to stand down for six months. The Mahdi Army is widely blamed for starting a fierce battle yesterday with a rival Shiite militia in the holy city of Karbala. The fighting took place at the height of a major religious festival, and in the midst of hundreds of thousands of pilgrims. More than 50 people were killed. NPR's Corey Flintoff joins us from Baghdad. And Corey, what does Sadr's order mean, suspending all military activity for six months?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, it has been an open question for some time as to how much control Moqtada al-Sadr has over his own militia. He seemed to be unable to stop the militia's involvement in things like sectarian murders, organized crime. Can today's order have more effect than his orders in the past?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, as a practical matter, what's entailed in shutting down the militia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Corey, what about the Mahdi Army's struggle for control of the southern part of Iraq and control of a lot of Iraq's oil wealth, which is there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As we've heard from Corey Flintoff, the fighting this week in Karbala and, more generally, in southern Iraq isn't so much a Sunni-Shiite conflict. It's a conflict among various Shiite factions. And for more about what's at stake in that conflict and what role the Iran might be playing in it, we're going to turn now to Vali Nasr who's the author of the book \"The Shia Revival.\" Vali Nasr, in Karbala, first of all, who is fighting against whom and why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But the differences between those two big groups, are they doctrinal religious difference or ideological differences or is it affiliation by clan or neighborhood or what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does Iran back one side as opposed to the other in this conflict?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And first, how bad was the panic of 1907?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about you, Scott?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What made you decide you really did need help?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did that continue to get worse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Had it gotten to a point where it affected your work? Are you still working with Verizon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think it took you a while to finally go get help?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Scott, do you feel like you're a different person?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what is your status? As long as you're being treated, you won't have to go. But can they - you, at some point, if you get better, would have to go back to Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What were you promoted to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think you'll do to replace that in your life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If - and I guess I'd love to hear each of you answer it - if you have to give advice to a family today when one of the spouses was about to go off to Iraq, what would you tell them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Monica, what would you tell a family?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now what are people doing to get to safety if people are being asked to evacuate this mountain villages, yet there were flames like that all around. Where are they going?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now these fires have spread so quickly because it's been so hot and dry there, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John, how have Greek emergency officials been able to handle these forest fires?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Florida Democrats could pay a heavy price for moving up their presidential primary. The rules and by-laws panel of the Democratic National Committee voted today to seat no delegates at all from the state of Florida at the party's August 2008 Presidential Nominating Convention. Florida has scheduled its primary for January 29th, earlier than National Democratic Party rules allow. NPR's senior Washington editor Ron Elving attended the rule's meeting today, and joins us in the studio now to talk about just exactly what is going on. Ron, this sounds very serious. Does this mean that Florida is actually going to be cut out of the Democratic presidential nominating process?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it even conceivable that the party would shut out the fourth largest state in the country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about Florida Democrats? Could they decide to move the primary forward a bit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned that several other states have been considering moving their dates up, other states have already done so. What does this vote today mean for those states? Is this some sort of a message that's being sent out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about his proposal for U.S.-Cuban relations, and how is that message playing? Is that something that he's using to reach out to these potential voters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How was his speech received there today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Star NFL quarterback Michael Vick has signed a plea deal admitting to being part of a conspiracy to run a dogfighting ring. The ring included gambling and killing dogs that didn't perform well, but Vick says he didn't bet on dogfights. Vick's plea agreement was filed today in federal court in Richmond, Virginia. He'll appear on that court Monday to formally plead guilty in the case. We are joined now NPR's Tom Goldman. Tom, what did Vick say about his role?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what is the plea agreement say about gambling?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But come Monday, Michael Vick, we assume, will plead guilty to a federal felony. What's the NFL's next move?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've gotten a sense today what Michael Vick's side, what his lawyers have submitted in a way of his end of the deal. What about the prosecutors' part of the deal? Do we know what they're going to ask for in the way of a sentence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does this FedEx Cup series work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But as fans of professional golf know there's a structure. There are tournaments every week. They move from Florida to California. Then there are major tournaments, and then there are international competitions - Ryder Cup, President's Cup. Why this? Who needs this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You say you'll be able to repair the damage in a short period of time. In your state, have there been any deaths or have there been many injuries because of Dean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the evacuation of villages that were in the storm's path. We've heard reports that in some small Mayan communities, people didn't want to leave their homes, and they turned away troops with machetes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, assuming that there's not another hurricane coming through the Caribbean anytime soon, how long do you think it will take before Chetumal and Quintana Roo can be put back to normal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The case of Michael Vick has brought public attention to dogfighting, which is illegal but hardly unheard of. We might associate dogfighting mostly with the rural south and the west, but it's also very common in many cities, for example, Chicago. Tio Hardiman works at CeaseFire, a Chicago anti-violence group, and he's learned enough about dogfighting there to become involved with the Humane Society and the Best Friends Animal Society. Mr. Hardiman, how common is dogfighting in Chicago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what is the attraction that people say they find to dogfighting? Is it essentially about betting? Is it just because it's a blood sport? Why are people going to these fights?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When the stories about the Bad Newz Kennel broke, on the west side or south side of Chicago, I mean, was it astonishingly surprising or was this something that one might have assumed goes on and that well-paid athletes might be interested in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, in your own work, I mean, you're primarily involved in mediating between people. Your concern is people. Dogs are a sideline here. What do people tell you when you tell teenagers, say, that there's something inhumane about fighting dogs? What do they tell you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Hardiman, I'm just curious, before I let you go. You've come to know a great deal about this in Chicago, where you work and where you work with an anti-violence group. Do you think Chicago is extremely unusual among American cities in having a big dogfighting scene?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As families of the six miners trapped in a coal mine in Utah await word of their fate, so, too, do the families of 181 coal miners in eastern China. They were trapped underground on Friday after a dyke in the Wen River broke during torrential rains and flooded the mine. Charles Hutzler of the Associated Press is in Xintai covering the story. And Charles, I gather that family members have been protesting at the mine company office. What's happened there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A number of the miners - most of the miners actually in the mine at time it flooded did make it out. What have they said about what happened down there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, if you were, or someone else for that matter, were running a public employee's pension fund of some sort, would you naturally invest in those securities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And year 13?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any teeth to this? What would the penalty be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you mentioned that psychiatrists had already taken up this issue. What took the APA so long to grapple with this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Bob Egelko who has covered the story for The San Francisco Chronicle. From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Debbie Elliott. A strong and dangerous hurricane is plowing its way through the Caribbean Sea, taking aim at Jamaica and other island nations. Hurricane Dean is packing 150-mile-an-hour winds, and forecasters say it could gain even more strength as it churns over the warm waters of the Caribbean. At least six people died in the storm as it moved through the eastern Caribbean, devastating banana and sugarcane crops. Dean is south of Hispaniola and is expected to dump as much as five inches of rain overnight on Haiti and the Dominican Republic, both nations prone to floods and mudslides. Forecasters expect Hurricane Dean to make a direct hit on Jamaica tomorrow then move over to Cayman Islands and on to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. I spoke earlier with Cecil Bailey, the deputy director general for Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management. I asked him what preparations were underway?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are you most worried about? What part of the island do you think is most vulnerable?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you talk about setting up of shelters on a small island nation like you have, where do you put people? Where is the safest place for people to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you feel like you have all the supplies that you need?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The quake struck on Wednesday. Can you describe the scene for us there today, three days later?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are the rescue workers finding any survivors as they work through the rubble?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does it look like there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds like people have become desperate. There are reports of looting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand that in the confusion after the quake, there was a prison break and several hundred inmates escaped. Are they still at large?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, whatever happened to the dirty bomb allegations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, he now is convicted, what kind of sentence does he face?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dina, what does the conviction of Jose Padilla say about whether these terrorism cases can be tried in the regular criminal justice system?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we're talking about Padilla, first because of his notoriety as the alleged dirty bomber, someone who supposedly was planning to - planned some kind of a radioactive device or tried to learn how to make one. And also because his a sort of celebrity litigant - one of those. But, he was only one of the three defendants in this case. The other two coconspirators were also convicted. Was he the main object of the prosecutors here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is a timeline of the Jose Padilla case at npr.org. The iPhone is widely acclaimed as a masterpiece of design \u2014 all those digital functions packed into one device. Well, it turns out, the rub is that very analogue, very low-tech phenomenon known as the phone bill. With an iPhone, you get AT&T service and an AT&T phone bill that might rival the federal tax code for density. Some iPhone users are getting bills in the mail that run 30 pages or 50 pages. And one customer Justine Ezarik, got a bill that runs almost 300 pages. She's a Web designer and a video blogger in Pittsburgh. And she joins us now. I assumed you join us on your iPhone?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how much have you used this phone since you bought it to have a bill that runs almost 300 pages?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many text messages do you run per month?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh, this was a light month only it was under 30,000?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what was it in the phone bill that made it so long?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now is this an option that you could do without? Did you say I don't need to see an entry for every single text message?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How can you possibly find enough things to say to make that many text messages in a day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " to a certain segment of our audience, that's self-explanatory. But for those who are little puzzled by what you do for a living, could you explain that a bit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what's the relationship, if any, between your career as a life blogger on the Internet and all these text messages that you're forever making?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...to the program. We've just heard in Pam Fessler's report someone describing the limitations of what you can do with a spy satellite. For a public that watches \"24\" or a movie like \"Enemy of the State,\" how close are we to real-time images that can track bad guys running through back alleys?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would imagery from a spy satellite over the Mexican border be able to tell you where and when people are typically coming across the border?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When we see what's done with this - a close-circuit television imagery in Britain after crimes have been committed, it seems that all those images are very useful to go back and see what happened, that is, retrospectively. Would that also be a use of satellite imagery as opposed to real-time predictive uses?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Happenstancially?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Journalist Michelle Nijhuis writes about science and the environment from her home in Western Colorado. A demonstration earlier this summer in the Chicago suburb of Berwyn, Illinois. The demonstrators on bicycles were rallying in support of a sculpture at Cermak Plaza Shopping Center, a sculpture that achieved worldwide exposure in the movie \"Wayne's World.\" It's called \"Spindle.\" It consists of a 50-foot high spike on which eight cars are impaled. The car at the top is a VW beetle. The one just below is a BMW that the owner of the shopping center donated to the artist Dustin Shuler back in 1989. Now the reason that we're talking about this and the reason the cycling protesters demonstrated is that the Dustin Shuler sculpture is scheduled for removal in order to make way for a Walgreens. Mr. Shuler joins us from Inglewood, California. How do you feel about them taking the \"Spindle\" away from Cermak Plaza Shopping Center?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was the idea here with this piece that you were getting at?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " An old hotel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of a blimp crashed into the ground. What is it about transportation disasters that is so attractive to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, is it gratifying to know that there are Friends of the Spindle, Save the Spindle demonstrators who've turned out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The rattlesnake is venomous, and the Gopher Snake, I gather, is not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I assume, since there's still are California ground squirrels around, this is relatively successful and it has protected them from rattlesnakes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the arms race between the rattlesnakes and the ground squirrels, have the rattlesnakes come up with anything remotely as interesting or sophisticated as this tail flagging and heat emission?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many years did you study squirrels for this project?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And did you develop a healthy respect for the squirrels during that time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if he had his hands in so much policy, his arms reach so deep within the White House, what would they do without him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Out the door, but is there a chance that he's really just changing venues, and he's getting out of the White House, but will still be very much in touch with the president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just quickly, any chance that he'll be picked up by one of the many 2008 presidential candidates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That was NPR's White House correspondent David Greene. He joined us from Iowa. In Miami, closing arguments began today in the three-month trial of accused al-Qaida operative Jose Padilla and two co-defendants. The men are charged with being part of a cell in South Florida that provided money and other support to terrorist groups overseas. A federal prosecutor today called Padilla their star recruit. NPR's Greg Allen is at the federal courthouse in Miami. Greg, Padilla became well known in 2002 when he was arrested and accused of plotting to set of a so-called dirty bomb - a radioactive device in the U.S. Those accusations are not part of this case, so what are the three men charged with?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, because of the history of his own arrest, we hear more about Padilla than about the others. How much of the case is actually about him, and how much is it about the other two?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what does the defense say about these three?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does these mean that the previous counts were off-based or does this mean that tigers are declining in larger numbers than expected?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's going on here? What is threatening the tiger populations in India?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've said that people and tigers cannot co-exist. What do you mean by that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you're calling for setting aside lands for tigers only, keeping people out, vigorously keeping poachers out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've written many books about tigers, your most recent is called \"The Last Tiger.\" Do you have a story that you could share with us about the tigers that you have been watching in India?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So at this point, the Central Bank steps in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can the Central Banks keep doing this forever?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Right. Well, I want to first get to the three Republicans who are not participating in that straw poll, the Republicans that we just heard about in the conversation with David Greene. We'll try to tick through this quickly and I want to begin with John McCain, the one-time frontrunner. What's going on in his campaign and how risky is it for him to skip Iowa?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yes or no, can he bounce back?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. Let's continue to tick through this, someone who's not even in the race yet, Fred Thompson. I want to say all right already. Is he in or not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, attracting a lot of media attention of late, but not the kind the campaign wants. However, he's still leading in national polls. Is that about name recognition?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Quick turn to the Democrats. National polls this week show that Senator Hillary Clinton has widened her lead over all the other candidates, particularly Barack Obama. What's at work there, particularly since it's still a three-way race there in Iowa, where you are?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Therefore, I, Sheila Dixon, mayor of the city of Baltimore, do hereby proclaim August 9, 2007 as Frank Zappa Day in Baltimore and do urge all citizens to join in this celebration. As the presidential primaries have moved up over the years from March to February to January, people have wondered how long it would be before the first votes were cast in December. Well, this could be Santa's year. South Carolina Republicans have reportedly decided to move their primary to mid-January, triggering a chain reaction that could cause Iowa's caucuses into this year. NPR's senior Washington editor Ron Elving is with us. Howdy, Ron?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what's the news here? Why are we suddenly thinking about voting and jingle bells at the same time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So okay, for about a generation now, it's been South Carolina leading the southern states, but following the New Hampshire primary. Traditionally, that's the first in the nation - and the Iowa caucuses. Why the change here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So okay, the big state jumped to February and Florida broke away to do January 29th and that crowd South Carolina. So now, Ron, stop the madness, I mean, can we just all get along here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why is Iowa different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK, and what happens if Iowa doesn't get - what happens if Iowa doesn't get its time there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK, Ron, quickly, when will we know?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now who's behind the measure and what's the motivation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When would this go on the ballot and what kind of election? What's the timeline?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do they face an uphill battle to get this on the ballot?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now how many other states apportion their electoral votes based on congressional districts? And how many other states are thinking about doing this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jon Katz's most recent book is \"Dog Days: Dispatches from Bedlam Farm.\" That was NPR's Carrie Kahn. She's in Huntington, Utah. And she's on the line with us. Now, Carrie, I'd like to ask you more about that news conference by Robert Murray, the owner of the mine. In your piece, you mentioned the sometimes-raw emotion and anger as Murray spoke to reporters. We heard a bit in that cut of tape, that anger and that emotion. What was it like there, especially when he started criticizing specific members of the press corps and various experts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the people there? The other workers, the families, that's coal mine country up there, a lot of people have stake in those mines. How did people react to Mr. Murray's statements?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Carrie, you mentioned that this could take up to three days to actually find the trapped miners and that they're bringing in these listening devices now. How long do they think that their miners might be able to survive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's happened in Adhamiya?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what does this mean for the daily lives of people inside either Kadhamiyah or Adhamiya?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tim, how's that different from the FISA law that was already on the books?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's establish a few of the housekeeping facts of her life, if you will. What was your mother's name?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What year was your mother born?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think you have given her memory with this book?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm fine. Could you please tell us exactly what happened in this case late last March and who was charged?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, two of the administrators - the dean of students and the director of Greek Life - both who are among the five people charged here, weren't present at the party. So how does the prosecutor justify charging them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in your stories for The Times of Trenton, you also talked about a young man named Adriano DiDonato, who's been charged and he is the house manager for the fraternity. Was he at the party?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you have told us about three of the five people charged. Who are the other two?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How has Rider University responded to these charges?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the penalty for the charge - aggravated hazing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This must be causing quite a stir in the community. To your knowledge have criminal charges ever been brought against college officials in cases like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I had heard about this ban, and New York and New Jersey and Illinois are all considering statewide bans so there might be a lot of chefs listening to this. Tony, could you please give us an idea of what's in your faux foie gras?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does it taste? How close is it to the real thing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you were developing this, did you do anything of that sort of, you know, chef's kitchen taste test kind of thing where you were trying to see if two people could tell the difference between the faux and the foie gras?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I guess not just the streets of Washington are boiling over today but the atmosphere in the House is pretty hot as well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So in that atmosphere, did they get anything done?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do they have to bring it up today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we did a little poking around here and found out that this is pretty complicated. Can you please give us an explanation that isn't it, if you will, too sticky? What are these forces - chemical and physical - that cause adhesion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Bell, could you explain for those who really need help, like me, exactly what an ionic charge is?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " some packing tape. Let me try to unstick this tape from this cardboard package. So what happened, chemically?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This plucking a cello is nothing new in the world of classical music but it's a seldom-used technique. So how does it account for 90 percent of what we hear on this new CD?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The cello is so associated with classical music, but these songs come across us as folk music, almost, and they are road songs, really. I mean, could these songs have been played on a regular six-string guitar?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you bring a lot, but what does it bring?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's the hippie family. So when you came to do this album, did you start with the images or did you start with the music?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " \"Airstream Envy\" is one of the songs on the CD, and it's not plucked. You used a bow for this one. Could you tell me the story behind the creation of \"Airstream Envy\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I should mention your father is the photographer Lee Friedlander, one of America's most extraordinary photographers and really known for American subjects and recording artists for Columbia Records like Rey Charles, Aretha Franklin, John Coltrane, back in the '50s and '60s. Do these people have an influence on you musically?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was there a moment when you knew that you were going to be a musician?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think you share with your father's sense of taking the camera and going to new situations? I mean, is there something that when you think about music, are you, in any sense, using your art and instrument the way that he use his?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Erik Friedlander's new CD is called \"Block Ice & Propane.\" It will be released on August 14th. Erik joined us here in NPR's performance Studio 4A. Would you play another piece for us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, a very long to-do list and the clock is a-ticking. So, what do you expect the House might get to before they adjourn?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. And that seems to me, like, that would be very complicated if the evidence that you're looking at is all mangled and crushed. It would seem that a lot of what you're looking for would be destroyed. How do you tell what's what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look at what happened in Minneapolis with this bridge and a collapse this massive, would you be expecting that the evidence you're looking for would be pretty large and obvious, or might it be a very small piece that would give you a clue?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When it comes to getting the debris out of the Mississippi River, is there a premium on doing that fairly quickly? Can there be problems with disintegration, corrosion when things are underwater?"}

In a few moments, we'll hear a report on today's finale of the scandal-plagued Tour de France. But first Celebratory gunfire rang out in the streets of Baghdad today after the Iraqi national soccer team scored an upset victory in the Asian Cup finals. The Lions of the Two Rivers beat heavily favored Saudi Arabia - one to nothing - to bring home the cup and denied the Saudi team a hope for forced championship. NPR's John Burnett is in Baghdad where security forces hope to avoid a repeat of the violence that claimed over 50 lives last week when crowds poured into the street to celebrate Iraq's semifinal victory. Hi there, John. Can you tell us what you're seeing and hearing?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it's not supposed to happen from whatever at the number of chromosomes that a mule comes away with from its parents, a horse and a donkey, should not permit fertilization - successful fertilization. So what kind of explanations have you had from people as to why this has happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Kate, that is, yes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Laura Amos of Colbran, Colorado, the owner of Kate, the mule, who, despite some pretty heavy odds against it, gave birth. The continued clashes between Congress and the White House these days have senior news analyst Daniel Schorr thinking, can this be what the framers of the Constitution had in mind?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In 1907 when the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company announced that it would build a skyscraper on Manhattan's Madison Square, it was going to be the tallest structure of its kind in the world, and no air conditioning. It's because air conditioning haven't been invented yet. So it somehow fitting that the current occupants of the MetLife Tower have found, if not a substitute for air conditioning, a clever low-tech supplement for it. They use ice. Credit Suisse occupies most of the building today, and William Beck is head of critical engineering systems for the company. And, Mr. Beck, what have you got in the basement there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you have these huge tanks that are full of water that you freeze?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you do this overnight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So when people come to work in the day at the building - overnight, the building has been making enormous ice cubes downstairs, and then, that cold is piped up through the building during the day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much does this save you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, as somebody who works in a building where - I wouldn't say we complain everyday - but climate-controlled is not the strongest suit of our building here, do you find that you get complaints from folks in the building? Or are they happy with the building?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you open the windows in the building upstairs in the MetLife Tower or no?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, all this is about cooling a building. What about heating the building in the winter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just get inside the building and you're warm for that reason?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The much bigger challenge is cooling?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, there's another kind of bet that you can place on a game that an official might have some effect on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But how would the official influence whether 190 or 180 points was scored in a professional basketball game?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the points spread, though? I mean, if there's an eight-point spread, could an official so artfully - he's only one of three officials of the game to begin with, could he actually make calls in such a way that would affect that outcome?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the past, the Turkish army has been the guardian of the Ataturk revolution, and they've stepped in when they thought the country was going off the track. Is that still possible that the army might, well, stage a coup possibly if they don't like the extent of Islamism in the government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now briefly, there's one another dimension of the election. A number of candidates were elected as openly as Kurdish politicians. It wasn't all that many years ago when Kurds couldn't identify it all as Kurdish couldn't speak, Kurdish couldn't broadcast or publish in Kurdish. Is that likely to change the politics of Turkey?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, Tammy Faye Bakker - that's how I think of her - had such a huge outsized presence in the 1980s and it seemed that she was constantly surrounded in controversy back then. Now that she passed away, do those controversies seem as integral to her character as they did back then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think she retains so much popularity through the years, no matter what her husband did, even when he was not seen so positively?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Many aspects of her life seemed to be at odds with others. At the end, she had always been a passionate evangelical Christian but then she devoted the fanbase(ph) among gay people and drag queens, RuPaul narrates your documentary. She was also one of the first televangelists to reach out to those with AIDS. How did she come to that kind of awareness and acceptance?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The United Nations pulled out of Iraq after the tragic bombing in August of 2003 on its Baghdad headquarters, which killed the chief of mission and 21 others there. Now, some U.N. staff has since returned to Iraq. I'm wondering is the secretary-general telling you that it's now time for the United Nations to reengage in Iraq in a big way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this a U-turn on the administration's part? I mean, several years ago, Collin Powell rejected a French-German proposal to have the U.N. get more involved in the government of Iraq. So is this a reversal of previous thinking?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ambassador Khalilzad, you yourself served as the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad. You know very well how hard it's been to reconcile the Iraqi factions. And now you're calling for the appointment of a new U.N. envoy to Iraq. I'm wondering how a U.N. mediator can succeed where a talented diplomat like yourself and some others have occasionally and very often in fact felt stymied?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're asking the neighbors to do more, the border countries around Iraq - Jordan, Syria, and Iran, of course - and I'm wondering, given the U.S. role on the Security Council, are you worried at all that the U.N. is seen as dominated by the United States in the region?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " By whom?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ambassador Khalilzad, I assume that in Friday's op-ed piece that you wrote for the New York Times, you were reflecting the administration's views. And I'm wondering if your op-ed means that the Bush administration feels that it's done all it can to reconcile the Iraqi parties, that it needs someone else to bring the Iraqis together to draft legislation on oil, or revise the constitution, demobilizing militias and the other things that you mentioned in the column?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the special envoy, where do you think he should come from? What sort of place in the diplomatic world should this person have held before?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Pickools. I like that title. What do they look like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do they taste?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So do people of all ages eat them or are they mostly favored by kids?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did this get started, this whole idea? I mean, I can't imagine mixing pickles with Kool-Aid anymore than I can, I don't know, peanut butter with sardines, I guess, you'd have to say. Is it been around?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to get your sense of what you think the role of the U.S. troops is today in Iraq and how it relates to violence in Iraq. One view is that U.S. forces are able, to some degree, reduce the level of violence in the country and be a catalyst for political developments that Iraqis must undertake. Another view is that we, by being there, are stimulating extremists terrorist groups attracting people and prolonging the conflict. Or that we're giving Iraqis too much time, that the sense of urgency is not there because the U.S. is there. What's your view? How significant is the presence of U.S. forces?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you say to an American who's listening and following the news who says, we went over there on some very bad intelligence, it hasn't worked out the way our leaders said it would, the time pressures on our military and the time pressures on your political leaders do not square, we're going to run out of strength before you've got enough of a reconciliation going, and it might be best for Iraqis as well for Americans to just get out of there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The list that you have seems to confirm what people have either suspected or, in some cases pieced together, that among the people the task force consulted, oil and gas executives were predominant, no?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The principle being one take on executive privilege that there should be confidential advice given to the president, or in this case, the vice president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the complaint of environmental groups has been that their point of view didn't have a chance to have any influence on energy policy. To what degree were environmental groups heard out by the task force?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was all the litigation that went to the Supreme Court preoccupied with process, while in substance, what came into office is what came to the energy task force period?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Beyond casting a spotlight on the poor, what does he actually want to do to help poor people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If these aren't traditional campaign rallies, what are the crowds like? What kind of reaction is he getting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned Bobby Kennedy. There are natural parallels to Bobby Kennedy's swing to the south several years ago to highlight the conditions among poor sharecroppers. But beyond the symbolism of this poverty swing, is poverty a potent campaign issue? Will it help lift the Edwards campaign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Rob Christensen is a political writer and columnist for the News & Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina. He spoke to us from Youngstown, Ohio. Interested buyers, take note. Bids are due later this week for Jaguar - or as they say in Britain, Jaguar - and for Land Rover. Both of those luxury car brands are currently owned by the Ford Motor Company. And now there's news that Ford is considering selling a third European brand in its portfolio, Volvo. Ford bought Volvo in 1999 for $6.5 billion. Micheline Maynard is Detroit bureau chief for the New York Times and joins us now. First, we should note that Ford has not come out and said it's selling Volvo, but it's not denying that it's looking at offers either. Is there a big difference there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the strategy here in selling off these prestigious brands that Ford acquired not all that long ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we paid a lot of attention to what happened at Chrysler, a venerable American automaker that was bought by a European automaker and then sold. In this case, with the European carlines, I mean, Volvo or, for that matter, Jaguar, would they change much by the fact of their ownership by an American carmaker?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now I have to - I say this as a confessed owner of an aged Taurus, but does it help sell Jaguars to make them look like a Ford Taurus?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, who's out there who might buy a Swedish carline?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The conventional wisdom is that McCain's days are numbered - that's Washington wisdom. How is he being received out on the stump?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So realistically, what are the chances that he'll be able to make a comeback?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Will they be standing shoulder to shoulder with the American troops, though, as they try to cope with the violence over the next 10 years, will there be tens of thousands of American troops in Iraq? Yes or no?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " war policy. But, I'm wondering if the president isn't some way asking members of Congress to abdicate their role, to advice and consent and guide the president particularly on foreign policy. And in doing so, to defy the wishes of their constituents, to essentially turn a deaf ear to what they're hearing back home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look at this administration, there have been a number of missed signals on the level of violence in Iraq after the invasion, on Saddam Hussein's weapon stockpiles, on a number of decisions about when and where to place troops, and when and where and how to replace certain people who are architects of the war. As the American public looks at what's happened in the past, why should they trust this administration to lead us out of this conflict? Why should they believe that this administration has the vision to find the best way forward?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you must have had quite a bit of security?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now when you mention al-Qaida, you're talking about al-Qaida in Mesopotamia. Is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Ureta, the image that you painted for us of darting in and out of buildings trying to avoid the gunfire there is quite vivid. I'm wondering beyond the diplomatic corps, what life is like for average Iraqis who lived in this region?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now that you're back, I imagine that everybody is asking you about your experience in Iraq and also your views. Your friends, your family, those you work with in government, what do you tell them when they ask you about the future of Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Had one of your convoys ever been attacked?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you know every time that you set out on one of these convoys, you're going to take on fire MR. SCHNEIDER: It's like or perhaps something worse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did you decide to go to Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And one of the benchmarks calls for laws establishing a strong, militia disarmament program. Any signs that the militias in Iraq are any less powerful now than they have been?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Here's a broad benchmark and it's an important one, benchmark number 13 - reducing the level of sectarian violence in Iraq. How are they doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I wonder what your take is of the need or necessity for these benchmarks. The U.S. ambassador in Iraq over the weekend told the New York Times, this is Ryan Crocker, said, the longer I'm here, the more I'm persuaded that Iraq cannot be analyzed by this kind of discrete benchmarks. Do you think he has a point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how - what do you substitute then for benchmarks? How do you measure progress?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Military analyst Anthony Cordesman with the Center for Strategic and International Studies here in Washington. We also heard from NPR's Jamie Tarabay in Baghdad. You can get a rundown of all 18 benchmarks that Congress set for the Iraqi government at npr.org. The presidential campaign of Senator John McCain received another jolt today -two jolts actually. His campaign manager and chief strategist resigned. McCain was once considered the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, but his bid has been hurt by weak poll numbers and disappointing fundraising figures. The resignations came as McCain was spelling out his views on the Iraq war on the Senate floor. He recently returned from a trip there. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson is following his development. She's here with us in the studio. Mara, tell us more about the men who left the campaign and why they decided to do it today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you said their bluff was called. How much of his troubles are really about mismanagement? How much are they attributable to his stance on the Iraq war?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Two key players gone. What's next for the campaign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you say - going back to being the underdog. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but are there any indications that he might get out of the race?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So once General Somervell agreed to build it on the new site because the president says this is where I want it. Why did they end up still building a Pentagon, they were no longer constrained by the lay of the land?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And they broke ground on September 11th?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Construction of the Pentagon proceeded at a furious pace. Sped up, three months later, when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Workers dredged 680,000 tons of sand and gravel from the Potomac to make the concrete for the massive project - five concentric buildings connected by a system of hallways. The outermost ring is called the E-Ring, a full mile around. The rings get progressively smaller until you reached the inner A-Ring. Where are we now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Steve Vogel leads me through the maze of hallways to the same shortcut that Pentagon employees have been using since the start - cutting right to the middle. They say if you used the open space at the center of the five pentagonal layers you can get from any one office to another in no more than seven minutes. So you've just taken us down a long corridor and now we've come out into a courtyard. I'm a little bit confused as to where we are. How do you navigate this complicated building?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who were these workers? What were they doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Once the building was completed in 1942, what was the response to the building?"}

NPR's John Burnett is following this and other developments from our Baghdad bureau. John, what can you tell us about today's attack?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, there were also reports today from the U.S. military of more than American deaths. Where did those occur?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John, the Iraqi parliamentary has been working on a new oil law for the country, and members of the U.S. Congress have been demanding progress on this issue. Any progress to report?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, history was made there at the All England Club as well today. Along with the championship trophy, Willliams will be taking home $1.4 million in prize money. She's the first woman champion to earn up hers equal to the men. Did she have anything to say about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand. Tomorrow in the men's final, we'll be seeing a repeat from last year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we know that security there at Wimbledon has been tight since last week's terrorist threats in London. But I understand that at the prologue to the Tour de France today, the first time the race has come to Great Britain since 1994, there was stepped-up security as well. Can you describe the security arrangement?"}

NPR's Linda Wertheimer has been traveling with Senator Christopher Dodd as he campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination. She's on the line with us from Council Bluffs. And Linda, is that who I think I hear on the background?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, is Mr. Simon pulling out any special lyrics for this occasion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it sounds like the crowd there is enjoying it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Good. Most fish live in either saltwater or freshwater, but a few species like eel and salmon migrate back and forth. How do they do this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk a little more now about the American eel. It lives a really long and rather remarkable life. Will you just take us through the eel's life cycle?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why is it important to maintain healthy eel populations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are eels really slippery?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And one of the main points of departure is right there with the founder of the Mormon Church, Joseph Smith, who is seen as a prophet. He received revelations, and his writings are, for Mormons, considered sacred texts, right, along with the Bible?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another serious point of contention with other Christian faiths is that Joseph Smith said God declared all faiths before Mormonism an abomination, is that right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Mormons today would still believe that their church is the restoration of the true Christian church?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if I understand this right, the belief wasn't just that he walked on the Earth, but that he walked on the Earth in the United States, in America?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is the belief that when Jesus returns, he will reign and govern the world from America, and specifically, I think, from Missouri? Is that right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that culturally, apart from any theological divisions, that culturally that secrecy has contributed to the view of Mormonism as other?"}

It's been open for three years. It sits directly between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Water sprays noisily from the fountain surrounded by stone pillars with bronze wreaths. Each pillar bears the name of a state or a territory. To me, it definitely suggests a memorial, but does it really suggest the Second World War?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You think it works?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you see a monument like this one, or the big World War II Memorial or the Air Force Memorial that we saw in Arlington, do you get the impression that the city that gave us the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial and the Jefferson is on a cold streak? Are we just doing something more appropriate to the times? Do these give you the same sensation you have when you see the grand old monuments of the city?"}

Police have said that incident and the two car bombs found in London last week are connected. NPR's Rob Gifford joins us now from London. And Rob, what have we learned today about the investigation?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " To find out more about who might be behind these attempted attacks in the United Kingdom, we turn to Anthony Glees, director of the Center for Intelligence and Security Studies at Brunel University in London. Mr. Glees, Prime Minister Gordon Brown says it's clear this is the work of people who are associated with al-Qaida. Is that clear? What are the links here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think this is some sort of a message for Gordon Brown as he starts to take office?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the status of al-Qaida in Great Britain? Is there a local affiliate there? I mean, after the transit attacks, there was much talk of homegrown terrorism in Britain. Why now is there talk of this being linked to al-Qaida?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have authorities recently there, though, considered that there is an active al-Qaida unit operating in Great Britain?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lord John Stevens, who is the new prime minister's terrorism adviser, wrote today in Sunday's News of the World that the recent incidents signal a major escalation in the war being waged by Islamic terrorists on Great Britain.

Into the debate now comes Stephen Abraham, a military lawyer who worked on Guantanamo detention cases. He has filed an affidavit questioning the fairness of the hearings used to determine who is detained at Guantanamo. We'll hear from him in a few moments.

Automakers claim they cannot meet the new standards and produce the kind of cars that Americans want to buy. And they've launched an ad campaign to make their case. Unidentified Woman #1: Hey, how do you like your car? Oh, I love it. I know it's a little bigger than others, but we really feel safe in it. Well, I hope you're planning on holding on to it for a while. Unidentified Woman #2: Why? Woman #1: Because Congress is about to pass a law that's going to make it harder and harder to find a car like yours. An ad there from the auto industry. So why can't automakers increase fuel efficiency as proposed in the energy bill and produce larger, sturdier, vehicles? We put that question to New York Times reporter Micheline Maynard. She's the paper's Detroit bureau chief, and she reports on the auto industry, and she joins us now from New York. So that claim from the auto industry, they can't possibly meet these standards and meet America's appetite for larger vehicles. Is that true?"}

When leaders of the group of eight industrial nations hold their summit in Germany this week, climate change will be high on the agenda. European leaders want the U.S. to take stronger action to combat global warming. After he took off as President Bush took the U.S. out of the Kyoto Protocol, but in the days leading up to the G8 summit, he's been signaling readiness to reengage in the fight to curve greenhouse gasses. He briefly outlined his plan in his Saturday radio address. President GEORGE W. BUSH: Under my proposal, by the end of next year, America and other nations will set a long-term global goal for reducing greenhouse gasses. And to meet this goal, we must help developing countries harness the power of technology.

Teddy Roosevelt was president in the early 1900s; the West was closing up. It was obvious that we might run out of the resources we need; and so a movement grew to use the resources we have wisely, and this is the dawn of the conservation movement. And he pushed Congress to enact some important legislations - the Newlands Reclamation Act provided for the construction of dams and canals. He used antiquity's(ph) act to expand - acreage in the national forests. It went from 42 million to 172 million during his presidency. He added 51 national wildlife refugees, and he organized the first conservation conference. So he really put it high on the national agenda. And where did it go from there?"}

They say negotiations are at a dead end. The Lebanese army continues to pound their positions and there are concerns about civilian casualties inside the camp. NPR's Deborah Amos spent the day just outside the camp near Tripoli, and she joins me now. Is the army making preparations now for its final push into the camp?"}

They were mostly peaceful, but some masked protesters attacked police with rocks and bottles, leaving 140 officers hurt. Hardy Graupner is a reporter for the German network DW. He joins us on the line now from Rostock. Can you describe the scene for us there today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what is their - what are they there to do other than cause trouble? Are they protesting the G8?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you tell us first, in optometry, how you distinguish between what it is that an eye chart, as we normally think of it, tests and what it is that this Pelli-Robson eye chart tests?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if you were to try to figure out what's most important about my vision - to figure out if I should have a driver's license or if I should go see an eye doctor instead - how did the two skills measured by these tests compare?"}

Earlier this month, an 11-year-old Alabama boy was hunting with his father in a commercial preserve where he shot and killed a wild hog. Now, we report this item neither to praise nor condemn young Jamison Stone but only to remark on the extraordinary size of the animal. The hog, whose picture is circulating on the Internet with the alacrity of a diet coke and mentos geyser video, weight - according to Jamison's father - 1,051 pounds and measured nine-foot-four from snout to tail. We're not taking Mr. Stone's word for this. Jerry Cunningham owns Jerry's Taxidermy in Oxford, Alabama, where he is in the process of making the monument out of this monumental animal. Mr. Cunningham, how big is this hog?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ambassador Crocker said today after the meeting that the Iraqis, the Americans and the Iranians all agreed that the focus of their discussion was on Iraq and Iraq only, implying no linkage to all the many other sticking points between Washington and Tehran.

From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. The presidential primary season just can't wait, it seems. Today, the state of Florida broke out of the pack, the dozen or so states that are planning to vote on the same day, February 5, 2008. Under a law signed by Republican Governor Charlie Crist, Floridians will take their bite of the apple one week earlier on January 29. That is still after the Iowa and Nevada caucuses and the emphatically first in the nation primary in New Hampshire, but it is the same date as the South Carolina primary. And with New York and California voting on February 5, it makes Florida by far the biggest state with an early role in the presidential nominating process. Well, Adam Smith is political editor of the St. Petersburg Times. And Adam, I'd like you to explain something to us. Florida could actually be penalized by the national committees for jumping - for going so early. But obviously, it's very important to someone in Florida to have an early primary. Why? Why is it so important?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And to do so, they're taking a risk here. What are the penalties they might face from the national party organizations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any candidate who campaigns in Florida would receive no delegates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do we know whether advertising on a television station in Miami or Orlando qualifies as campaigning in Florida?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, obviously Governor Crist and the legislators in Florida understood that there would be some push back from the national party organizations. And yet even so, they - do they think that they can cut some deal in the end with the national parties?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But when you said don't count the vote, are you actually referring -and we're thinking of Florida right now - to the actual process of counting the ballots, not doing that on the 29th?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's getting warm enough to start thinking about beach reading, but what to pick? If you're tired of \"Law and Order\" detective thrillers, our head butler, Jesse Kornbluth, recommends you try taking a more criminal point of view. Jesse, a criminal point of view?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A Robin Hood?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And who wrote these books?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So tell me the kinds of adventures that Mr. Lupin has?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sounds a little bit like maybe Cary Grant in \"To Catch a Thief\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you like to read a selection for us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So after reading this, Jesse, tell us were you tempted to just sneak around to your neighbors' and make off with all their jewelry?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Senator Kyl, last year, you were adamantly against any path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. This bill would now allow them to eventually become citizens. What changed your mind here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What things did you want to have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I understand some business interests are not exactly pleased with the idea of a guest-worker program that caused people to work for two years, then go home for a year and then come back for two years because of the stability issue. Wouldn't this be a problem for, say, agri-business in Arizona?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Senator Cornyn of Texas, another border state, was a negotiator on this deal, but had second thoughts and now does not embrace it.

The country under attack is Estonia, a tiny Baltic nation that's a member of NATO. Since coming out from under Soviet domination, Estonia has become a leader in computer technology. Since late April, hackers have been jamming the Web sites of the Estonian government and the nation's newspapers, political parties and banks. The cyber crisis began while Estonia and Russia were in the middle of a political crisis, sparked by Estonia's decision to remove a Soviet War memorial from a central square in its capitol. This led to a blockade of the Estonian embassy in Moscow and Russian threats to Estonia's oil supply. Ian Traynor has been reporting on the cyber scuffle for the Guardian. He joins us from Brussels. Tell us what happened. How did these cyber attacks unfold?"}

And now onto more basic science in our weekly segment Science Out of the Box. This week's topic: a breakthrough in physics. No, it's not the uncovering of another subatomic particle or a revelation about dark matter. It's a discovery about something you're likely to dig your toes into soon - sand. Douglas Durian, a professor at physics at the University of Pennsylvania, is one of the two scientists who made the breakthrough that we're going to talk about, and we're going to let him explain it. Dr. Durian?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now I spend a lot of time at the beach, and my kids love to play in the sand, but why is it that physicist would be interested in the way sand behaves?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So when the ball hits the sand, is the sand acting like a solid, a liquid, or a gas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, so let's talk about the practical applications of this. Is this going to help me keep my golf ball out of the bunker at all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh, well. But what are the practical applications?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As David Greene just reported, Paul Wolfowitz or his representatives are engaged at this hour in discussions over his resignation as World Bank president. NPR's Tom Gjelten is following this story and joins us now. President Bush sounded as if he might have been saying farewell to Paul Wolfowitz just then. Is he on the verge of resigning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Difficult and protracted, so when - once they finally do reach an agreement, would Paul Wolfowitz stay on for a while or leave immediately?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any idea who might replace him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just quickly, Tom, do you get a sense that they're even allowing themselves to engage in those discussions, to look ahead about his - to talk about his replacement until they work out the conditions of this deal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If we look ahead and if it's possible that the unity government won't survive, if it does fall apart, what happens then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If these clashes continue, what might it mean for the Palestinian authority?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One thing that's curious is that Gaza slurred up when the West Bank, at least for now, appears to be quiet. How do you see that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As we just heard in Linda Gradstein's piece, many residents, at least from one area, are calling for a harsh Israeli military response. What does this mean for the region and also how might this affect the overall peace talks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This past week, General Benjamin Mixon, the U.S. commander in northern Iraq, said that he doesn't have enough troops in Diyala province, which is increasingly violent, as you know. By concentrating U.S. forces in Baghdad, which is the current surge strategy, isn't the enemy simply moving elsewhere?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You yourself are credited with using the phrase: the long war. And I'm just wondering if one can have an elegant strategy. You've got some of the best minds there now working in counterinsurgency. Is this a matter of devising, say, a perfect chess strategy, but with public opinion being as against the war, as it now quite openly is, do you ever feel that perhaps the chessboard and the chess pieces are going to be removed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " To Afghanistan now, where Afghan officials reported today that a senior Taliban commander has been killed. Mullah Dadullah died in a U.S.-led raid in southern Helmand province. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is following this story from Kabul and joins me now. Soraya, what exactly happened to Mullah Dadullah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it matter if U.S. or Afghan forces kill an individual Taliban leader, even one as high ranking as he is? He's said to have been close to Mullah Omar. But is this going to change Taliban tactics?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to ask about another news report today, Soraya. Gunfire between Pakistani and Afghan troops along the border in a couple of provinces, what happened?"}

Firefighters have contained more than 40 percent of the blaze, and authorities have allowed residents to return to their homes on most of the island. But they've barred tourists on what was supposed to be a busy Mother's Day weekend. About 3,000 miles away, another wildfire has been burning along the Georgia-Florida state line, producing thick clouds of smoke and low visibility. Sections of Interstates 10 and 75 were shut down after multiple accidents were caused by drivers disoriented by the smoke. For more on the wildfires there, we turn to Troy Roberts of the Lake City Reporter. He's in Lake City. Hello, Troy Roberts. What's been going on today on the interstates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, fires have been a problem for how long? Can you tell us more about the source?"}

In Pakistan today, violent clashes between pro and anti-government demonstrators in the city of Karachi leaving at least 30 people dead and more than 100 wounded. Gunfire erupted in several parts of the city. The violence is prompted by the visit to Karachi by Pakistan's chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudry, a man President Pervez Musharraf suspended two months ago in what critics of the government say is a battle over judicial independence. NPR's Philip Reeves is following the story from his base in New Delhi, and joins me now. Philip, would you please tell us what happened today in Karachi?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you remind us, please, why Musharraf suspended the chief justice back in March - I believe it was March 9th?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How has President Musharraf been reacting to what appears to be escalating tensions between these two sides?"}

This morning the university opened its complete collection of letters from Flannery O'Connor to Elizabeth Hester. The collection had been sealed for 20 years. Ever since 9/11, the U.S. has been obsessed with terrorism and with illegal immigrations, so how is it that three of people - who know stand charged with plotting a terrorist act - lived here illegally, openly and sometimes recklessly for years. Reporter Leo Strupczewski of the Cherry Hill Courier-Post has reported on the status of the three Duka brothers. He joins us now by telephone. And Leo Strupczewski, first of all, they were here illegally. How did they get into the United States, first question?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Initially, on some legal visa, do you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, we have the family with young children encountering the public school system in New Jersey, and I gather the kids went to school?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " After they finished school, the Duka brothers - well, they applied for driver's licenses, we know about that? Yes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the Dukas were not the most law-abiding citizens of the road in New Jersey, from what I gather?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Again, though, he was here in the country, living in the country illegally, but those encounters with traffic court just didn't trigger any examination of his immigration records?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you ask people about this in Cherry Hill, what's their reaction to the intersection here between immigration status and minor infractions of the law?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Leo Strupczewski is a reporter for the Cherry Hill New Jersey, who's been covering the story of the alleged terrorist plot in Cherry Hill. So the man who heralded the triumph of new labor in Britain will likely leave No. 10 Downing Street an unpopular leader strongly identified with his advocacy of the war in Iraq. What legacy does he leave? Has Britain's Blair created some place that is uniquely Blair's Britain? To address those questions, here's Peter Riddell - columnist for the British daily The Times and author of a Blair biographer. Peter Riddell, what do you think? How would you describe or write down the legacy of Tony Blair?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that Tony Blair's policy on Iraq and his closeness to George W. Bush is part of a larger British alignment and Atlanticism that will now stick and that is a permanent legacy of his? Or, is Iraq just a peculiar one off issue that happened to attract Blair enthusiastic support?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, now I know that it's really up to historians with the benefit of some passage of time to make historical judgments. But to simply speculate right now on what those judgments might be, do you think Tony Blair's going to be remembered as one of the great prime ministers of contemporary Britain, like Churchill or Clement Attlee for that matter, or is he in the lower tier, do you think, of the national leaders?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But to put this in some context here, you have been a positive voice for real estate. So much so that a couple of years ago, you published a book in 2005, who's original title was \"Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?,\" To which I must say, I already missed the real estate boom. But you were saying, the subtitle of that book was \"Why Home Values and Other Real Estate Investments Will Climb Through the End of the Decade.\" What went wrong? Where was the point where you stopped seeing real estate values going up through 2010 and something happening to a recession?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But beyond the impact of 9/11, you mentioned the subprime lending market. Hasn't that been falsely sustaining demand for housing all this time by bringing in homebuyers who really don't have good enough credit to buy a house?"}

NPR's Jamie Tarabay joins us on the line from Baghdad. And I want to ask you about benchmarks, which we hear people talk about in this country all the time, things the Iraqi government has to do to ensure continued support from Washington, an oil law - and de-Baathification. Do people in Iraq talk about benchmarks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, so Vice President Cheney arrives in Baghdad. What is his message to the Iraqi government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now even as Vice President Cheney was arriving in Baghdad and being there, I gathered there was a large explosion in the Green Zone, but it didn't affect his visit at all. Is that right?"}

A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition confirmed a significant number of enemy fighters were killed yesterday but said he had no reports of civilian casualties. Word of the attack comes just a day after the U.S. Army apologized and paid $2,000 each to the families of 19 Afghan civilians who were killed in March. In that incident, Marines open fire on people in Nangarhar province after a suicide bomber drove a van into a special operations convoy. Well, joining us now to talk about these civilian casualties is Jean MacKenzie - country director for the Institute of War and Peace Reporting, which is a London-based group. She is in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. And, Jean MacKenzie, how much doubt is there about the number of civilian casualties in this latest attack and for that matter in general?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do we know about the battle that involved the bombing that claimed these civilian lives in Helmand province?"}

China has launched a nationwide food safety inspection, including an official investigation into the export of tainted ingredients used in U.S. pet foods. The contaminated products are believed to have caused deaths of cats and dogs and led to a broad pet food recall. Food safety has become a big concern in China, where more than 32,000 people suffered from food poisoning last year. NPR's Anthony Kuhn has been following this story and joins us from Beijing. Anthony, what did China find out about the tainted pet food ingredients?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But in the case of the pet food, we are not talking about some accidental contamination. We're talking about purposeful adulteration of food supplies, and then, fraud, falsifying documents. What does this say about regulation in China today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think, by the way, that when the Chinese citizens read about this sort of thing that they associate this kind of shabby criminal business behavior that's been alleged with the export trade, or might the products that they are consuming themselves be treated equally badly by their producers or processors?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are the Chinese cooperating with the United States on this one?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And did the process start almost immediately?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how many elms have you raised so far?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many years - how many decades would it take for the elm to be restored to the place it was, say, before the 1930s when it started really dying out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And does a Princeton elm look any different from an elm that might have not survived the Dutch elm disease?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, one of the other things he spoke about tonight was the relations with the rest of Europe. He said, quote, \"France is back in Europe.\" What does he mean by that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are some of the other international issues that will be on his foreign policy agenda?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've heard emergency officials report that this is the most significant emergency the state of Kansas has witnessed in a very long time. What were people telling you, the survivors there at the shelter? What were they describing happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We understand the rescue activities are still underway today. What do you know about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Debbie Elliott. A Newsweek poll out today gives President Bush the lowest approval rating of any president since Jimmy Carter - 28 percent. The poll also indicates the president may be dragging down Republican presidential contenders. When pollsters matched up the leading Democrats against the Republican frontrunners, the Democrats came out on top. This weekend, the Democratic hopefuls have been courting support from black politicians. They've been in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where the National Conference of Black Mayors is holding its annual conference. NPR's David Greene is there, and joins us. David, is this one of those obligatory stops on the road to the White House for Democrats?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " David, people have noticed that Senator Obama in some of his speeches has been has been sounding critical of some aspects of African-American culture, particularly hip-hop artists. Did you hear more about today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did the mayors react? What did they have to say about these two candidates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the other two hopefuls, Senator Edwards and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And now, a different kind of horse race - the real thing. A favorite took the fame, Run for the Roses, today. Street Sense pulled up from the back of the pack to win in the stretch at the Kentucky Derby. Our own Adam Hochberg is at Churchill Downs in Louisville, not only to watch the Derby, but to watch its most famous spectator, Queen Elizabeth. She's in the U.S. to mark the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement but as an avid horsewoman, the queen managed to time her trip perfectly so she could catch the first of the U.S. Triple Crown races. Adam, an exciting finish for Street Sense today. What can you tell us about this horse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the queen, did she appear to enjoy the competition there today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Adam, I know you don't gamble, but tell me you did, at least, try a mint julep while you were there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A few weeks ago on the program when much of the country was shivering through an extended spring cold snap, I talked with our commentator, bird lover Julie Zickefoose. And Julie, back then, temperatures where you were in Whipple, Ohio, were in the 20s at night, 30s in the day. And you were really worried about migrating birds, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you were worried about that if they have to die off, that they were just hanging back, waiting a little bit, and now you're getting delayed gratification, I guess?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Snoring?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We have a recording actually. This is not a recording you or I made. But that was very good, Julie. This is from the McCauley Library at Cornell's Lab of Ornithology. Let's listen to the blue-winged warbler here. Does that sound like what you're hearing in your backyard?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Julie, when we talked back in April, you had a blue bird who was sitting on five eggs in your front yard that were due to hatch pretty soon after that. How are they doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How are you controlling the house sparrows?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Should I ask what that is?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When we talked back in April, you said that the dawn chorus of songbirds you would expect to be hearing in early spring was really muted. Is that completely changed now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you said pressing a button on the card and there's a display on the - is this still the same size as a credit card?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would there be a battery inside the credit card to do this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If I press my credit card today, a number will come up. If I don't use my credit card for a week and then I press it then, would that same number come up or is my credit card's own circuit thinking all that time and advancing through a large number of codes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, then how would the matching number back home know what my number is? And how would it validate that selection if it depends on when I press the button on a credit card?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, are we likely to see this on the market anytime soon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. David Utter speaking to us from Lexington, Kentucky, where he writes for WebProNews. This is NPR. And Carrie, what's been happening there now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But as you have said, the crowds in Los Angeles are smaller. Even in Chicago, which may have had the biggest turn out, but today's crowds are a lot smaller than they were a year ago. What has changed, though, in this past year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Carrie, are the events in Los Angeles overwhelmingly Latino, or is it more of a mix than that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what is going to happen the rest of this evening in Los Angeles? What's on schedule?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, as a piece of public investigation, how would you describe the Winograd Commission's report?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We have a prime minister who is, you know, who was polling usually in the single digits before the Winograd Commission reported. Can somebody that weak who's leading Israel into such a - what appears will be chapter of internal self-scrutiny about its leadership. Can he actually do anything in the peace process either with the Palestinians or the Syrians or whoever it might or whether this is the Arab League peace plan for that matter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But you don't have a conversation with them like I'm a having a conversation with you. How do you communicate with them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What exactly is a lexigram?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you know that the bonobo is taking that to a different level, that it is an actual linguistic skill?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, are you going to give them certain choices, certain names to choose from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where do turkeys roost? Are they up in the trees?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if we're lucky enough to bag a turkey when we're out on our hunt, what's the next step? How do I get this ready to take to the table?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Like what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does the government react to the statement?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Abdullah Gul was considered a compromised candidate. He is identified with the liberal wing of his party. How does he see the role of Islam in the state?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what are the secularists worried about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So when you're putting those forecasts together, what - how do you do that? What are you drawing on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds like you have to trust your, well, more than your gut, but it's some sort of instinctual thing you have at this point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah. You worked that in a lot, I guess?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dan Abell. His last forecast there today after 35 years on public radio station KWMU in St. Louis. Now, to talk about U.S. policy towards Sudan, we're joined by Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer. She was in Sudan earlier this month with Deputy Secretary John Negroponte. They visited a refugee camp in Darfur, and they met with Sudanese President Omar Bashir. Ms. Frazer, what was your message to President Bashir on the war in Darfur?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would you describe the tone of that meeting you had this month with President Bashir?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the tone from the U.S. side?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You have met yourself with President Bashir several times before. Have you ever known him to come through on anything that he's promised you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Bush spoke at the Holocaust Museum here in Washington last week and he said: The time for promises is over. President Bashir must act. But if you look back, you'll see a lot of statements, say, from the special envoy to Sudan, Andrew Natsios, who gave a January 1st deadline, saying that punitive action will be taken if Sudan didn't step up to the plate. It's now April 26, no punitive action has been taken. Why should the government and why should President Bashir take U.S. threats seriously at this point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how long would you hold off then until action is taken?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution last August mandating a U.N. peacekeeping force in Darfur, did you think it would be eight months and no peacekeepers would be in Darfur?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what do you chalk that up to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's the resolution?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's his stronger hand to play?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your colleague at The Weekly Standard, Fred Barnes, wrote this week, McCain has made himself a better candidate by embracing the Iraq War as the centerpiece of his campaign. Do you agree?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He spoke of his experience today when he announced his candidacy. Experience can be seen as a euphemism for being old also. Is it possible that the very aura of newness, that you remarked on back in 2000, just isn't a quality available to him this time around?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, before 2005, there were federal loans that did enjoy that kind of protection from the bankruptcy laws. So this was extending a protection that existed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What would you say your view is of Boris Yeltsin's place in history?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As we heard in Michele Kelemen's report, he does leave a mixed legacy. Let's talk first about his legacy as a reformer. What lasting positive changes would you look at in Russia today and say, Boris Yeltsin is responsible for this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you remember anything in particular that Boris Yeltsin told you about his hopes for the Russia that he was leaving behind when he left office?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As you mentioned, he chose Vladimir Putin as his successor. When you look at the retrenchment of liberties going on in Russia now, how would you compare the legacy of Boris Yeltsin and the rule of Vladimir Putin?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the general impression of how the Democratic candidates are doing with South Carolina voters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is Barack Obama seen as somebody who might have a stronger chance of winning nationally?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you find that Barack Obama is managing to maintain the appeal of being a fresh new face, even as he becomes a little less fresh and new with every passing week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How are the Republican candidates doing there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How's he doing this time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, do such Republicans as Mitt Romney and Rudolph Giuliani, do they actually have any traction with South Carolina Republicans?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Rudy Giuliani in South Carolina?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I'd like to ask you first: how come? And are these dual class stock structures, or are they unique to the newspaper business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's talk about The News York Times, and who is it, who among the shareholders want to undo this dual-class share structure, and why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the means by which the people who want to end this dual-stock system that The Times - the means of their attempting to do that is at tomorrow's stockholder meeting. They're asking stockholders to withhold their votes from the inside, the family's choices to be directors. Is there also any possibility of, say, SEC action, or a lawsuit to undo this system?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, Greg David, thank you very much for talking with us. And you can assure us that Crain's New York Business doesn't have a dual-stock ownership system?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now twelve candidates in all ran today. When you look at those also- rans, is it possible to see whether Sarkozy or Royal will have the advantage?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now it sounds like this election really pulled people to the polls. What was the sense you got today out talking with people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what is the election going to be about from here out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Coming up on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, the perils of political satire in Afghanistan. From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Debbie Elliott. We begin our program this afternoon with today's tumultuous presidential elections in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. With this vote, for the first time, Nigerians will be handing over power from one civilian-elected president to another. But dozens of people have died in election violence. Just today, troops shot and killed three boys during a protest and there were reports of serious voting irregularities. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is in Lagos and joins me now. Ofeibea, how widespread was the trouble today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happened in those polling places where people were not able to get a ballot?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell us a little bit about the candidates. How many are running for president and who is thought to be able to win this election?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When are the results expected?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ofeibea, given the troubles that you've been reporting on over the past week, along with the corruption and poverty that you've reported on in Nigeria, what are Nigerians hoping for from this election?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what are the alternatives for menopausal women, especially those who have severe symptoms? What are their options?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Doctor, what about herbal therapies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about bio-identical hormones?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What if you're someone who is presently taking hormone therapy, despite the published risks. How do they transition off that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...and (unintelligible). Did that bring a great many police onto the Virginia Tech campus?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Everyone who is in that room, you're saying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we're making - perhaps I'm making the logical leap here that the gunman in the classroom was the same person who was the gunman in the dormitory. Is that just assumed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do people there account for the lack of a larger response between the first shooting in the dormitory at 7:15 and these later shootings two hours after that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have investigators said anything about who the gunman was?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From what you saw, Greg, and what you heard, how intense did this rally get?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now this is the latest in a string of protests by the opposition group led by Kasparov called the Other Russia. What's the program and how much support did they enjoy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Garry Kasparov has, of course, been very outspoken. He was detained today and then later released. Was he charged of anything?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what did Kasparov say when he got out of court?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm wondering about people in the parliament. The parliament met yesterday in a show of defiance. What are Iraqi politicians saying about this attack in this secure place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Sudarsan, al-Qaida in Iraq has claimed responsibility for the attack in the parliament building. You report in today's Washington Post that several Sunni militias are distancing themselves from al-Qaida in Iraq. Is there any sense in which this could be construed as good news?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Today, another bridge was bombed, the Jadriyah Bridge, as we mentioned -the second bridge bombing in three days. How has this affected movement in the city, travel, and has it noticeably changed the way that Baghdad is being patrolled by either U.S. or Iraqi forces?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the deadline for the exchange is this week and you said it would take an extraordinary effort to actually meet that deadline. Why is it so hard to do that, to meet that deadline and what happens if they don't?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The U.S. seems to be at a constant standoff with North Korea. Governor, many people listening to this will wonder, why should anyone take North Korea at their word?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does the U.S. at this point approach North Korea from a weakened state since that country knows full well that this country's military is stretched rather thin?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when you look at these attacks in North Africa, do you see a pattern, an escalation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the group in Algeria that claimed responsibility, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb - Maghreb meaning North Africa - is a new name for a group that existed before and it reflects some kind of new partnership. What do you know about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could it be something as basic as would-be terrorists from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, wherever, would be going to al-Qaida training camps somewhere else?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do these groups in North Africa have popular support?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how do those governments respond to these groups?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Don't touch it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Joyce, does Tom sometimes make his own breakfast?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When did that stop, the breakfast?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What would happen if he tried?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's coming right up, huh?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh, you mean before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you know what the disease is called, Tom? What you have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You worry about your son having the same disease that you have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Joyce, what are you hearing when Tom talks about his illness this way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Joyce, do you try to ask Tom about what he remembers? What he's aware of? Or do you just try to absorb it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When I was looking through Tom's book, he describes you, Joyce, as being very private, and we're sitting here talking about very personal, intimate things. Why do you let us come and talk to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Albert, when you listen to Tom and Joyce talk about where Tom is, what do you hear? Where is he in the course of his disease?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it a common thing when you talk to Alzheimer's patients to hear them be aware, as Tom clearly is, of what he's lost?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look demographically at what's happening with Alzheimer's disease, we mentioned it's estimated more than five million people have it now, what are the projections of how that number will grow?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What seems to show the most potential for treating Alzheimer's?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There has been a lot of hope around the possibility of a vaccine for Alzheimer's disease. Where are we with that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Albert, when you think back on the eight years that it's been now since Tom DeBaggio was diagnosed, how much better do you think we understand Alzheimer's disease now than we did then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But despite Vonnegut's constant threats to stop, he kept writing and kept talking, and kept making his jokes right up until his death. It's as good an example as any until the aliens really do come. Greetings. Peter Sagal is the host of NPR's news quiz, WAIT, WAIT, DON'T TELL ME. I'm Melissa Block. You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Ryan McCartney is the editor of the Duke daily student newspaper, The Chronicle. And Ryan, how is this news playing on campus today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has the Duke paper editorialized about what should happen in this case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what was the gist of the editorials that your paper ran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This case spread far beyond these three young men. The lacrosse coach was fired; the lacrosse season was cancelled originally. What have the other repercussions been that are still being felt on campus?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have applications declined?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, regardless of whether a crime was committed here, this whole case seemed to expose something broader. And a lot of people talked about, you know, class divisions and race divisions that put Duke and the lacrosse team in a very unsavory light. Do you see that anything has been done to try to take those issues on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Help us understand one distinction. We heard there in David Welna's piece about an alternative bill, one of the sponsors is Norman Coleman, that would do research on stem cells, allow research on stem cells as long as they're not derived from viable embryos. What's the distinction there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " At the same time that this debate is going on at the federal level, you see a lot of action being taken by the states. California has a $3 billion commitment over the next decade for embryonic stem-cell research. Plans in New York for a $1 billion funding program. If there's this much state money available, how necessary is federal funding?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the meantime, what's going on in other countries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How is your transition back home going?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Like what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, how are you making a living these days?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And that is a contractor to the U.S. government there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Bilal, can you paint a picture for us of how your home city, Erbil, has changed over the past two years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you mentioned that Kurdistan has - had not the problems with security that the rest of Iraq has had. You mentioned the investment that's there. You also mentioned that you're seeing a lot of refugees coming from points south. To what extent is it clear for you in your daily life that you are living in a country at war?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How are Iraqi Kurds dealing with the influx of refugees there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, Speaker Pelosi says your delegation delivered exactly the same message as the Bush administration has been delivering to Syria. Is there any danger here of sending mixed diplomatic signals when you have members of Congress who appear willing to engage with countries that the administration is not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your delegation issued a statement saying that you strongly urge President Assad to control Syria's border with Iraq. You want him to stop the flow of foreign fighters who are a threat to both U.S. troops and Iraqis. Did President Assad acknowledge his country's role in Iraq, and with Hezbollah, and with Hamas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your delegation presented the U.S. demands on Syria when it comes to its role in Lebanon, in Iraq, with Hamas. What did Syria indicate it would want in return from the U.S. in order to start to address some of these issues?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You had stops in other countries as well as Syria - Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Israel. Overall, what do you think this congressional trip achieved?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was it that disenchanted you with President Bush?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When the president was asked about the New York Times story last week in a news conference this week, he said I respect Matthew, he was an integral part of my 2004 campaign. But then he said that you have a son in the Army who's awaiting deployment, and he said I understand his anguish over the war. I understand this is an emotional issue for Matthew, as it is for a lot of other people in our country. Is he right about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When I interviewed you in 2004, during both conventions in fact, we talked about Iraq. During that campaign, Iraq for most Democrats was viewed as a discrete, separable conflict from the war against al-Qaida or the war against terror. For Republicans, it was the central front in a global war on terror. You linked Saddam Hussein to the war on terror. In 2004, did you believe it sincerely and do you believe it now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But by 2004 that was very much in dispute, and people had raised questions about vague Czech intelligence reports of a meeting in Prague between Mohamed Atta and somebody else. It was in debate. And to what degree was this a policy belief of yours, or were you the good professional partisan and your job was to make the case for the Bush campaign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, part of that is breaking with what you said, is in effect saying I was wrong. But what would you say is right today? What should be the policy in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just one other point I wanted to raise with you. It seems that President Bush in his - first in his commitment to defend Secretary Rumsfeld when there was a chorus of people from both parties and former generals suggesting that the secretary should go, and in his current treatment of Attorney General Gonzales's woes with the dismissal of the U.S. attorneys - the president seems to be remarkably loyal to the people whom he has brought into government, and personal loyalty seems to figure a great deal in this. Did the president's relationship and his sense of loyalty figure in your calculus of how to go about publicly breaking with him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...to the program. There have been groups clamoring for the decriminalization of marijuana for decades. I'm just curious, have they gained any political traction over the years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We are approaching a presidential election here. Do any of the potential candidates say anything about changing the drug laws?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In drug law enforcement today, how would one quantify first of all marijuana - as opposed to methamphetamines, cocaine or heroin - when it comes to arrests or people in jail?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're drawing a distinction between decriminalization and legalization. Where is the distinction greater than merely a semantic one?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But wouldn't treating marijuana like alcohol mean that people who smuggle or sell marijuana, and who might very well traffic in other drugs too, would be legitimized in a way that a lot of Prohibition-era bootleggers became respectable distillers, cabaret owners and liquor wholesalers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you find that the off-the-record discourse and discussion of decriminalization of marijuana with people in office or people who are in various law enforcement agencies, is it remarkably different from the on-the-record public discussion of marijuana?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You have been criticized not just by President Bush and Vice President Cheney for this trip, but even The Washington Post editorial page devotes an editorial called, Pratfall in Damascus, about your visit and talks with President Assad. Was this trip worth it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you say that's what you told Syrian President Assad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell us, in Saudi Arabia, what did you hear from the Saudis about the House Democrats' preference and your preference for the U.S. to start withdrawing from Iraq next year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But just to clarify, when you met with the Saudi monarch, you didn't talk about withdrawal from Iraq with him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what do you want to hear from him when you do talk to him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did you hear that Nathan was going to be released?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it the kind of thing that when you hear it, you just can't quite believe it's true?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you see your son on TV when he was being held captive by the Iranians?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, there's something very odd about how this all unfolded at the end, with them getting these gray suits from the Iranian government and these sort of gift bags. What do you make of all that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were telling me a little earlier that this was your son's first deployment with the navy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think he'll be ending up going back to the region?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what's going on right now in the town of Hayle there in Cornwall?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You think so?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if you think it is broken, how would you think it should be fixed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know what New Hampshire and Iowa would have to say about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we spoke to you last week when the crisis was still heating up. Your reaction to today's news?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is a lot of speculation as to why Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would make this move and announce it in quite this way. Do you have any insight on what happened behind the scenes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We saw a little bit about today when he was shaking hands with some of the captives, joking with one of them; so you came on a mandatory vacation. Were you surprised to see that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Karim, what does this mean for Iran in the long run in terms of the country's standing and its often-contentious relationship with other countries, including the U.S.?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In terms of the stalemate, as this played out, Tony Blair seemed to go out of his way to be firm, but as he said, to be non-negotiating but also non-confrontational. Is this a case where Iran has responded positively to quiet negotiations? And is there a framework, I guess, looking towards the future for dealing with this country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as we just heard, the president had harsh words for the efforts to tie the funding for the war to the withdrawal date in Iraq, and he said again that he will veto any bill put before him that actually does so. So what is your response to his comments today in the Rose Garden?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as you know, there's a certain amount of finger pointing in Washington and some are saying that you and the senator are acting a bit stubborn as well. Why not work toward a compromise? Why send the administration a bill that you know full well is going to be vetoed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But just, you know, to look at this from the other side, is it possible to see this in another way. Because it is such an important issue, is it appropriate to play this kind of political chicken?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're in your home district right now and you've been a strong and outspoken critic of the war. Are you hearing anything from your constituents that gives you pause at all? Are you hearing from constituents who are concerned that the troops might suffer if you do withhold funding?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The president today suggested that lawmakers return early from their spring vacations. He said come off vacation to get a bill to my desk. Any chance of that happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, if we look down the road a bit, two weeks from now, if the two branches are still in the same position, looking at each other, not moving closer at all, what happens then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That was Senator Russell Feingold. He's a Democrat from Wisconsin. Psychiatrists have a strict definition for depression. It's more than just unremitting sadness. To be classified as depressed, patients also have to have several other symptoms. For example, a change in appetite, trouble concentrating, or problems making decisions. There's a bereavement exclusion for people who otherwise meet the definition but have just lost a loved one since they may just be responding normally to a loss. Now several mental health experts are suggesting that people who have just gone through other life problems, such as losing a job, should also not be categorized as depressed if it looks like their symptoms will be temporary. Joining us is psychiatrist Dr. Michael First of Columbia University. He's the editor of the major handbook for psychiatrists, \"The DSM-IV.\" He's also co-author of a new study of depression. Dr. First, thanks for being with us. Dr. MICHAEL FIRST (Psychiatry, Columbia University) Thank you for having me. Let's begin by talking about this survey of people with depression. What did you see in terms of looking at people who had experienced a stressful event as opposed to people who are, say, clinically depressed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when you say temporary, what do you mean by that? Two months, three months, six months, a year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, based on your findings, how many people do you think are currently diagnosed with depression but are really just suffering a normal reaction to a big loss?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And beyond the questions about diagnosis, are there also questions about treatment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the harm or the danger if that happens, so if they are as you say, put in the same bucket?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there implications here not just for those who treat people with depression but for those who live with them and experience this along with them who might advice people to seek help if they think they're actually going through a depression?"}

What has it accomplished, and where are we in that battle? That's what NPR correspondent John Burnett set out to find when he began looking into the war on drugs. His investigation leads the series, and he joins us here today to talk about it. John, what drew you to the subject?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, before you left, we talked about your post-traumatic stress disorder, something that hit you late in life decades after you left Vietnam. How did your post-traumatic stress disorder affect you when you were there in Iraq, in the field?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When we last spoke with you, Mr. Konrardy, you talked about how on your last day in Baghdad you wanted to shake hands with the soldiers and your old platoon, to hug them if they would let you. Were you able to give this goodbye to today's platoon that you've felt like you never got to do back in Vietnam?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if the rate is to be variable, can you be told at closing what it's going to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if somebody who is attending to this closing, the lawyer, or if it's a mortgage broker, if somebody does not come clean and says don't worry about it, here is what the payment will be at the beginning (unintelligible) from what I read in the Wall Street Journal, it's not going to happen. Is that a violation of any law if one skimps on that obligation? Or is it simply bad practice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I've been describing to you the hypothetical of buying a house and taking out a mortgage. Many people, obviously, refinance their homes. Is there anything different typically about the prices of refinancing from buying initially?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A closing typically involves initialing about nine thousand entries on multiple copies of many, many forms. Do you think that this is a problem of those forms not stating clearly what the lending terms are, or simply of consumers not having the wherewithal or the confidence or the ability to decipher what's in the forms that they're initialing?"}

He also sits on the Federal Reserve Board's Consumer Advisory Council, and you can find their guidance on sub-prime loans, as well as a primer, at npr.org. We hear that Marines from Camp Pendleton in California are hitting the local tattoo parlors in force today. That's because the Marine Corps commandant announced a policy change last week. Starting Sunday, April 1st, new, very big tattoos below the elbow or the knee are banned. The commandant says it's bad for the image of the corps. Well, Jerry Layton(ph) is a tattoo artist at Body Temple Studio in Oceanside, California near Camp Pendleton, and Jerry Layton, how's business today?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " The bicep or the chest, it's still fair game, yes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And that's - for you and me it might be an expression of freedom to dress as we like from day to day, but a Marine accepts that kind of discipline. So there are differences, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And Dr. Russell, we're talking about two things here. One is a study about MRIs detecting breast cancer and then these recommendations from the American Cancer Society. Let's talk about the study first. What did it conclude?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So they're saying along with mammogram, those patients should get an MRI?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. Now at the same time, the American Cancer Society has updated its guidelines for breast cancer screening. And what are you recommending now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who's included in that group?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how many women would be included in those high-risk groups that you're talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would there be enough MRI machines, MRI centers, trained radiologists to perform all those new screenings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And MRI tests are quite expensive and that raises a lot of questions about cost and insurance. Would these tests be covered?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And What about for women on Medicare or Medicaid?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you're saying that these women should also still get a mammogram. Why is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One problem with MRIs is that they do have quite a high rate of false positives. So where does that lead you?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " One year ago today, half a million illegal immigrants took a stand on the streets of downtown Los Angeles. They were protesting a congressional effort to criminalize illegal immigration. The demonstration came to be known as the Grand March and inspired similar marches and rallies across the country.

NPR's Carrie Kahn has been watching today's events and joins us now from L.A. Carrie, what's the scene there?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Debbie Elliott. Hundreds of scientists from around the world including Jane Goodall are attending the \"Mind of the Chimpanzee\" conference in Chicago this weekend. It's being billed as the first major conference to discuss the mental capabilities of chimpanzees. Thirty researchers are presenting their work on how chimps think, including evidence of empathy, cooperative problem solving, and the ability to deceive others. Elizabeth Lonsdorf is director of the Fisher Center at the Lincoln Park Zoo and one of the conference organizers, and joins us on the line now. According to this latest research, how well did chimps understand what other chimps know, feel and perceive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell us a little bit about Knuckles?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, researchers have also found evidence of chimp deception?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jane Goodall is an important speaker at your conference. What is influence on this research?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This was a very close vote, as we've heard from Andrea Seabrook. There were some people who crossed the aisle, but by and large pretty impressive party discipline on both sides. What was going on behind closed doors all week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, this is a spending bill and some Republicans outside of Congress looked at it and said, talk about pork, there's money for livestock in this bill. There's $120 million dollars is essentially for the shrimp and herring industries in it. Is this a pork-spending bill to round up votes or is it any different from past bills?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've heard two very different appraisals of where this vote in House takes the country, one from a Democrat who voted for it, sees an end of an era - meaning an era of the Iraq war. President says the Democrats have voted on something that was all theater and will never become law. Who do you think is right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if somebody has the forms, what's missing from them that they should know about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And for those of us who buy tax preparation software, would the forms that we get online when they're updated, would they show these deductions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how much do people typically pay or stand to get back in the way of a credit for this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you are strongly in favor of the bill. Are there any loopholes that you're worried about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now a lot of this genetic information is going to be in your medical record if you undergo these tests, and that is available to insurers. So what's to keep them from denying coverage based on that information and claiming that it's actually for some other reason?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Right now, a lot of patients, though, seem to take a don't-ask, don't-tell approach to genetic testing. They avoid it because they're afraid that it might harm their chances of getting employment in the future. How do you change that, even with this legislation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Kathy Hudson, there's actually been very few documented cases of genetic discrimination. Is this bill essentially a solution in search of a problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If insurers don't have access to this information, could you argue that this is going to essentially raise the cost for everyone else, that insurers can't make the best decisions because they don't have the best information?"}

Why did Bush turn to Gonzales time and time again? What was it that he saw in him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The book is subtitled \"The Rise to Power.\" Now, beyond Alberto Gonzales current title and his perch within the Bush Cabinet, is he truly a powerful personality?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We now know that on many of these controversial subjects - from the expanse of presidential powers, to the use of torture, to military tribunals -that there was a robust discussion about many of these measures. Based of what you know of Alberto Gonzales and his leadership style, does that suggests that he actually presided over those discussions and those debates, did he actively participate?"}

This weekend, the president of Pakistan, a key U.S. ally, finds himself in the midst of a constitutional crisis. It started when President Pervez Musharraf suspended the country's chief justice earlier this month. Friday and Saturday, demonstrators poured into the streets of several Pakistani cities, including Lahur. Yesterday the nation's lawyers demonstrated in their business suits and ended up clashing with police. Security forces also raided a TV station that had been reporting on the controversy. Graham Usher is a journalist based in Islamabad, and he joins me now. Graham Usher, please tell us about Pakistan's chief justice. Why did President Musharraf suspend him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I gather that President Musharraf had expected that Chaudry would accede to his demands that he resign and he showed some independence. Is there in fact an independent judiciary in Pakistan?"}

You began writing poetry though as a teenager and published your first poem when you were just 14, I believe 44 lines of blank verse entitled \"1944.\" Mr. Walcott, could you just take us back to that time and tell us a little bit about that poem and what happened when you wrote it?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds as if this is not only a place to which you've physically returned but also poetically. Twenty years ago, one of your poems, we referred to it in introducing you, called \"The Fortunate Traveler,\" there you talk about writing at 30,000 feet and seeing the world from a first-class airplane cabin, and those kinds of perspectives are of course very far away from the beaches of fishermen. Did privilege ever make it more difficult to write about work-a-day lives?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you still feel that after all these years and all these achievements?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " May I ask you if you would take us back to the very first attorney general under George Washington, how did the founding fathers originally conceive of this position?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Nancy Baker, there was probably no more spectacular moment for the Office of Attorney General than Watergate. When President Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire the special prosecutor Archibald Cox, Richardson refused to do so. He then quit. Then the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus refused to fire the special prosecutor. And it was such a chain of events. Did people feel that that was, sort of, going to be the end of the office at that time?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is an enormous amount of oil in Iraq. The big question is, will foreign companies be willing to deal with the violence and the instability there in order to get to that oil. What do you think about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you mentioned a few countries. What specific companies are interested?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If everyone is lining up, will the Iraqis let everyone in, or will they be selective? And if they are, what will be the criteria?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Some of the foreign investors are concerned that Americans will have a leg up in this process. Is that a legitimate concern?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The security situation in Iraq has kept reconstruction projects from moving forward in the oil fields and in the refineries. Can the oil companies actually do better?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Saad, I'd also like to ask you about corruption, which is also a huge problem in Iraq. Will that keep companies out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's your appraisal? Do you think this is a one-day event or the start of a major correction, as we just heard?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now with the close today the Dow was down more than 400 points. This would be a time, I would imagine, when you'd be getting some phone calls from your own investors. You have both, what, individuals and institutions saying: Michael, tell me, what do I do tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that a hard message to get through to people, though?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you seen something like this before, with that dramatic tumble so quickly? And were you grabbing your own chest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how do you train police there in Michigan to recognize someone who is in this state, which is called excited delirium? What do they look for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if officers are responding to someone who does seem to be out of control, what are the first initial techniques that you tell officers they should use when they're trying to respond and calm someone down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if voice commands don't work, what then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it a common experience that when people are in this extremely agitated state that they're not responding to pain in the way that you'd expect them to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what will officers tell you about what it feels like to actually be in a confrontation with somebody who is exhibiting superhuman strength?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you're dealing with someone who's believed to be in this state, would you call, say, an ambulance or medics or people who could actually tranquilize the suspect, lower their heart rate, things like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And then would that suspect be taken to prison or to a hospital?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sergeant Williams, we heard in reports from Laura Sullivan that there is a great deal of controversy about excited delirium. Civil rights groups feel that it's basically an excuse to cover up police brutality of misconduct. What's your perspective on that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Arizona - border state, obviously; immigration dominates a lot of political conversation there. You've recently come back from talks with the governor of Sonora in Mexico. Is that a way to sidestep the federal government and just work it on your own for what works for Arizona? Is that a long-term negotiation with Sonora? What is the purpose of those talks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What would you like to see them do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another area where states have expressed some frustration that the federal government is not doing all they wish it would is health care. What would you like to see happen on health care? Where can the states fill the gap, and what does the federal government need to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what exactly did Cuban officials tell these reporters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is there any doubt in your mind that this is a retaliation for reporting the Cuban government didn't like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what do you think this is about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how many foreign correspondents are able to operate in Cuba?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is there some expectation that that number would rise in anticipation of some sort of transfer of power were Fidel's health to fail?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about Cuban journalists? How hard is it for them to work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's an argument to be made that women tennis players play best of three, men play best of five. Often the women's matches are not as tough because there's not as much depth of field and that it's not equal work. So we're not talking about equal pay for equal work. What do you - what's your response to that argument?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So they shortened the sets instead of foregoing the corsets?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've written that if sports weren't based just on brawn, I think we women could compete. If there's a goal to sort of appreciate the game, whether it's tennis or basketball or golf, the way women play it, is it a different game, do you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And looking towards the future - in this country Title 9 has been around for 30 years - are you surprised we're still having this conversation? Do you think there'll be a time when we aren't anymore?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If it won't happen in your lifetime, you said, who do you see of the current generation of women athletes stepping up to be as vocal, you know, and persistent as you've been?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a little part of you that's resentful that you never got the equal prize money?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what was it about these new weapons in World War I that resulted in so many injuries to the face?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what sort of injuries would that result in? What were some of the characteristics of the men who needed facial reconstruction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You say in your article that Anna Coleman Ladd was inevitably described as a socialite. How does an American socialite who almost dabbled in sculpting become the sculptress of tin masks for wounded in Paris?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Our listeners can go to NPR.org and access photographs of these masks, but can you describe one for us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And 90 years later, is some version of a mask still used on occasion or has cosmetic surgery caught up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First off, is there any declaration or commitment that Hamas could say or make that would satisfy Israel that a Palestinian government, including Hamas, could be a partner for peace? Or does Hamas being Hamas preclude that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But you said today that that implies you're capable of hearing something else tomorrow and taking a different view of Hamas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if there were a declaration from Hamas, that we recognize Israel, we acknowledge past agreements, we renounce violence - those declarations would count for something?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another very important question: Iran. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns has said here yesterday that he came back from Jerusalem convinced that Israel and U.S. see the Iranian nuclear issue the same way. And he says there is time for diplomacy and sanctions. We should be patient. Iran won't have nuclear weapons for some use. Is that Israel's view of the situation as well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is the implications there that Israel, if Israel felt failed by the world in confronting Iran, that Israel would take action on its own?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Because the Iranians say you may not own up to it publicly, but everyone knows you have nuclear weapons in Israel. What's different from them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. And to - on the government side, who have they presented to challenge that evaluation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Greg, it sounds like traffic is picking up outside the courthouse where you are reporting from. Who do you expect to be testifying after they finish with the doctors?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in the end, if Jose Padilla is declared competent, what happens next?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay, Greg, thanks very much. NPR's Greg Allen outside of federal court in Miami. More news about supermarkets now, or perhaps it's more about what's in their parking lots, or what should be in their parking lots: shopping carts. This is Return Shopping Carts to the Supermarket Month, and it that weren't enough, Oregon State Senator Laurie Monnes Anderson has sponsored a bill to create a shopping cart hotline in her state. Senator Monnes Anderson joins us from Salem. Welcome to the program. And please tell us, who should call the hotline if there is one?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sort of a neighborhood shopping cart watch, you're describing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the problem with shopping carts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Not to belittle their problem, but there are actually shopping carts that grocers are spending $300 for a piece?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It this the motorized shopping carts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I see. Now, a few years ago, I was in San Francisco, where routinely the city collected shopping carts and there was sort of a pound where there were dozens and dozens of them, but they were taken from homeless encampments; the homeless where using shopping carts to move their belongings around. To what extent you think we're talking about people taking a shopping cart to put their bed roll and their belongings in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think they'll do that? That is, if so many carts are being wheeled away from the grocery by shoppers, will they actually be able to dispatch people to round up these stray and sighted shopping carts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That is Oregon State Senator Laurie Monnes Anderson, who has sponsored the bill to create a shopping cart hotline in Oregon. This is of course Return Carts to the Supermarket Month. The Prime Minister of Italy handed in his resignation today. Romano Prodi lost a key foreign policy vote in the country's Senate. And since his nine-month-old coalition government was deeply divided over a number of issues, he decided to call it quits. Now, this does not mean that Prime Minister Prodi is finished. To sort through all this, we're joined by NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome. And Sylvia, why don't you explain for us, what was the measure in the Senate that led to Romano Prodi's defeat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the government of Prime Minister Prodi has fallen but as we mentioned, he may have another chapter yet to write. What's going on there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, Sylvia, from this vantage point, it can seem that Italian governments fall all the time. Does this feel different to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have some handy metric for what's happened in terms of the volume of business or the number of calls or whatever it might be since that list came into effect?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there fewer people employed by the members of your association today than there were before the list took off?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you explain that for a second?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How is the cost calculated and who's making that calculation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But does that mean that in effect the federal government, by creating a list of exceptions of people who don't want to be called, is now in the business of selling the phone numbers of people who do want to be called?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Among the exceptions to the Do Not Call List, one was polling. And there were concerns that people were getting calls that sounded somewhere between a poll and a poll that was curiously about a particular product or service that they might be interested in. A poll that was really a concealed, veiled sales device. Is it happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another exemption was for nonprofit fundraising. Is that an area into which the direct marketers have been able to move more effectively?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Congress also saw the need to continue political calls. Is that an area where people who were trying to sell product a while ago are finding business working for political campaigns today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you pointed this out to members of Congress when you represent the Direct Marketing Association?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the idea of getting off the plane if it's been on the ground for three hours. Why three hours? How did you come up with that time period?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Senator Boxer, there was a similar hue and cry after similar flight-delay problems back in 1999. Legislation did not go through, but there was a voluntary pledge by airlines to meet customers' essential needs. What happened to that pledge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think it would mean that ticket prices would go up some if airlines did have to lay in supplies like you're talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was this the first big attack on one of these combat posts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Anne, today's attack took place north of Baghdad, in the Iraqi capital itself. This is the fifth day of the new security plan. What are you seeing in the city that's new and different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can you tell us about these documents, what they were and where they came from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of a strategy did they reveal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now what does this tell the U.S. military about the insurgency?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are U.S. officials doing with this new information, with what they've learned from the documents? Would you expect them to change flight patterns, maybe rely less on the air component?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Because this country is so rich in resources, who is profiting? Who makes the money from these resources?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What would I see if I were walking around on the streets of a town in Guinea?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who was responsible then for what has been going on in Guinea recently?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, given the recent protests and the nationwide strike, what are the prospects that things could turn around, that people are demanding change?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Rita Yahstead(ph) of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania writes, My own mother just died, and even though she was a severe diabetic and had congestive heart failure, her last trip to Florida for the wedding of her granddaughter is one we shall all remember. She and my father continued to travel no matter the inconvenience and difficulty, because, as you so aptly noted, it meant they were still alive. And finally, Kenneth Hutchinson was less taken with the piece we ran on the state of heavy metal. He writes, I cannot imagine that any of the millions of listeners to NPR could even tolerate that type of cacophony. For that matter, I cannot imagine that anyone with an IQ over 40 can tolerate it. You were just assaulting and angering everyone. If something you hear angers or delights you, go to our Web site, npr.org. Click on contact us and select WEEKEND ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Tens of thousands of Italians marched through the northern city of Vicenza today to protest plans to expand a U.S. military base that dates from the Cold War period. The protestors raised environmental concerns and waved anti-American banners. Leaders of parties that are in Italy's coalition government joined the march. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is on the line from Vicenza. Sylvia, what was the mood and how many people turned out for this protest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why are people there so angry about this U.S. base expanding?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sylvia, do you get a sense of real anti-Americanism in Italy today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did Ms. Luddy connect to these students who were so very different from her own background?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But the fact that you have singled out this very successful teacher in this successful school, if a school like this does show that it can achieve, isn't that enough?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you making the case that it is not possible to have a high performing inner city school over the long haul?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That the social conditions are such that that's just not attainable?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Something like froggy quarantine?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk a little bit about this fungus. What is it and how does it kill frogs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does it do to them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any idea where it came from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Pregnancy tests? How did that work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So these frogs were exported from Africa all over the country to be used in hospitals?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, how bad could it get? What is the worst case scenario here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, how do scientists know that the fungus is to blame for these frogs dying off and that it's not some other factors?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, remind us all of just what it would mean in the world if one third of the amphibian species were wiped off the planet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Caecilians, what are those?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a sense of how this would affect humans should this fungus wipe out one third of amphibians?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, Karim, tell us about this branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force. Who are they and what are their responsibilities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's interesting because conventional wisdom holds that a perjury defendant is ill advised in not taking the stand, that his word is at issue and the jury would, perhaps, need to hear from him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I imagine you're all quite busy right now reporting on this. And Vice resident Dick Cheney, why is he not testifying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the strategy behind that testimony, and were you able to glean it all whether or not that seemed to be working with the jury?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John Hanna seemed to be painting an interesting picture of Lewis Libby. How did the prosecution do when they had a chance to cross-examine him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, Nina, just very quickly, when will this go to the jury?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Eddie Feigner faced so many batters, including some very great Major League ballplayers. Who was his idea of the best hitter he'd ever seen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the stories about his life, it is mentioned that Eddie was a foundling and he was an orphan. Did that determine how he lived his life thereafter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Suleiman's father, Baba, is working against the government. What is he trying to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When did your family first leave Libya?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you ever wish that your father was not in politics, did not engage in politics? Did you ever try to talk him out of it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, your book paint Suleiman as a prisoner in his own home, somewhat confused by the politics around him. There are times where he is seeing prisoners being interrogated and tortured on television. The family's phone line is wiretapped. He witnesses his best friend's father being whisked away. How was it for him in his own home, growing up in that environment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you read for us from your book?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now years later he learns that his father dies of a heart attack. His mother is ill again, and his best friend writes him and says, you know, we need to hear from you. Yet he doesn't call. You get the sense that at some point it would have been okay for him to return to Libya. He would have been allowed to by the authorities, but he never does. Why not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You wrote in The Independent last September that - I'm going to quote you now - living without one's country is a kind of daily death, that exile is in essence an endless mourning. Does part of you wish you had remained in Libya?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now who found it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happened to the briefcase itself?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you share for us some of the documents?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think gave him his passion? What do you think motivated him to do this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How does the taste of the blood orange differ from the oranges, say, that we have everyday in our orange juice?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what do those varieties share? What is it about their taste that's different from the blonder varieties?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we have noticed that blood oranges tend to be a favorite on Valentine's Day menus. We've seen dishes like grilled snapper with (unintelligible) and beet blood orange chutney, or Mire lemon pistachio tort with rose water syrup and blood oranges. It all sounds very nice. What is your favorite way to eat a blood orange, David Karp?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I think I'm ready to hear it all in action. How about you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you remind me what a cadenza is?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You don't see yourself as a classical musician?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did you end up being able to rock out classically instead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell me about the marimba. This seems to be the instrument that really ignited your passion. What is it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What made it unplayable? What is so difficult about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you demonstrate the differences?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the difference in this mallet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did the composer actually write in the score put coins on F sharp?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds like this financial gulf between players in the NBA and the NBA's Development Leagues is just a fact of life. There must be, I guess, a lot of frustration for those who play at the very highest level of the game but can't quite get into the majors. How do you deal with that with your clients?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, Tom's piece mentioned how the global market for basketball talent is actually making that competition even fiercer for those who really want those coveted NBA spots. So how does that work for you? What's your role in that, in helping a player decide whether they're going to stay in the development league hoping to move in to the NBA, or take a shot in Argentina or Italy or China?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does play overseas come with the kind of ancillary income that a player can earn in the NBA - the endorsement contracts and commercial contracts and the like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's the income trend overseas? Is it likely that gap will lessen over time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Keith, do you get to the point with some of the players that they're knocking on 30 years old, and they're still in the D-L, and the NBA is looking like a distant prospect, not likely to happen - what's that conversation like at that point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the Senate actually voted last night, and there were not enough votes to continue with the formal debate on Iraq. What would have happened if they have actually had the necessary votes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So one question that has confused those who follow Congress, maybe even some of those who actually cover Congress - why did Senator Warner vote against his own resolution?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, where is the president and the White House in all of this? Is this stalled in part because the White House simply doesn't want this resolution to go to the floor?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Ron, could they still get a deal on this, this week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Turning now to the trial of former vice presidential aide Lewis Scooter Libby, where the prosecutor got to the heart of his case today. Libby is charged with lying to the grand jury and the FBI about his role in revealing the identity of a CIA agent. Today, the prosecutor played audiotapes of Libby testifying before the grand jury. NPR's Nina Totenberg has just stepped out of the courtroom to talk with us. Nina, now that the court has heard the bulk of the audiotape of Libby's grand jury testimony, what exactly did it hear?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The prosecution's theory is that this is a cover story to hide the fact that Libby did know and had in fact disclosed the information to reporter Judith Miller. So how is the prosecutor handling that with the grand jury?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Nina, we've talked about Judith Miller. Why did Libby say he talked to her?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Nina, a quick look ahead before we let you go. So tomorrow or the next day, we'll come to the end of the grand jury testimony and the final prosecution witness, which is expected to be Tim Russert. What's he expected to say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In your childhood mind, did you actually think that if you could just eat some of this food that you might be transformed into a real American, an all American in some way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you still obsessed with American food?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many contractors do we think there are in Iraq and roughly what do they do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you gotten any impression as to whether policy makers - or for that matter, senior military officers - regard this as an approach that's working? Do they seem to be satisfied with the relationship between uniformed services and contractors today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Exxon wasn't only the oil company to rake in big profits in this year of record-high oil prices, but $4.5 million an hour? How do you make that kind of money?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, car buyers have been showing more interest in fuel efficiency and even alternative cars. Is this the reason that there was more bad news this past week for Ford?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why is it that in recent years it's been mostly musicals that have been on tour?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What sorts of non-musical shows are we seeing on tour this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So why is this year different, Bob? Why are we seeing more plays and not so many musicals?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John, can you describe for us what's going on? What's the scene there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the survivors are just getting word today, confirmations of those who are killed. What are they telling you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This tornado struck during the middle of the night. There was little warning for people to take cover. And we know that Floridians have pretty good systems when it comes to hurricanes and being ready for hurricanes, which they have plenty of advance warning. What are they telling you about this tornado, and is this area used to being struck by tornadoes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tom, so much is reported about this game, and there is all this hype. What are you doing to cut through? What's your story down there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Very important. One more thing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who will be getting the prime time exposure this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Writer Dean Olsher, who says he did not literally kissed the ground when he returned home to New York today, though he did want to very much. Wall Street Journal sports writer Stefan Fatsis is with us, as he is most Fridays. And Stefan, we've been hearing about the part of football closest to your heart and foot, the kicking game. You spent part of December training to kick with the Denver Broncos, no?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Before we get on to all the non-kicking guys who will be playing on Sunday, there's only one kicker in the football Hall of Fame?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now obviously, Supreme Court justices like all political figures, or for that matter writers, go in and out of fashion and their ideas look better in different eras than in others. But how do you account for the fact that Oliver Wendell Holmes survived his tenure on the court, emerged from it as a giant of American jurisprudence and John Marshall Harlan as a role player?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did they get along with each other in the court?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One last thing one can come away with from reading your accounts of Supreme Court justices you write about is that at confirmation hearings we shouldn't be so interested in questions about what did you think in that particular case when you ruled on the appellate court? As rather, did you feel left out in high school? Or what were your parents' values? What kind of college experience did you have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So under your plan, that would make poll watching duty mandatory. Who would the pool be? Where would you be drawing these workers from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I gather that one criticism is that since voting is a purely voluntary civic exercise, to inject any component of that that makes it mandatory really goes against the grain and the spirit of voting in this country. How do you respond to that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, you mentioned what he did in China when he was a Maoist. He's been a lot of things politically over the years, yes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If what underlies all this, if the constancy in Jalal Talabani's career has been the Kurdish cause and the protection of the Kurdish people of Iraq, has he evolved into an Iraqi patriot? Does he place Iraq's welfare as president of the country and its continuation as an intact country above the Kurdish dream - which was I believe endorsed nearly all the Kurds when they had a non-binding referendum - of independence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As someone who goes back a long way with the Iranians and whose background is on personal politics developed along Marxist lines, what do you think he makes of the Islamic republic across the border and the prospect of it having greater influence in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where did this American sympathy for the restoration of the Jews to Palestine come, at a time when the Jewish presence in America was much, much, much smaller than it is today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yet the Minnesota Guard has undertaken some dangerous jobs. What's their role at Anaconda and in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you will be going out with them in the coming days?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Some of the state's politicians said it was frustrating for them as well. What did you say to the Pentagon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Since the extension of the National Guard brigade was announced, Governor Pawlenty, you and Democratic members of the state legislature have also proposed a bill in Minnesota to give additional benefits to the Guard, beyond what their federal benefits will be. Are you confident this will pass and could you tell us a little bit about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Governor Pawlenty, you're heading up the John McCain presidential exploratory committee in Minnesota. Do you share Senator McCain's support for the surge, as it's called, the escalation of additional troops in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If I could just draw you out a bit. You talk about the surge being too late. Well, some people would say perhaps too little, too late. I mean, you say that you supported it several years ago, but it's going on now. So what about the fact of 21,500 U.S. troops now? Is that something that you can get behind?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are you hearing from your constituents?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did Sinn Fein take this step now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does this bring a resumption of the power-sharing agreement in the government which had been provided for going back to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement but which had been suspended since 2002?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ian Paisley, we should say, is the Protestant Loyalist leader. What does this agreement today mean for the future of Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Jacki Lyden. The racehorse Barbaro injured in a heart-stopping moment during the Preakness last year has suffered another setback. Barbaro had been recovering from a shattered leg and was doing well. Now though, doctors have been forced to perform another surgery. NPR's Allison Keyes has been following this story and she joins me now. Allison, what's happened with the horse this weekend?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there any indications that the horse is in pain or uncomfortable?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I've had one for years. So if they can't manage to have Barbaro pull through this, what's the prognosis?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Good. So no one really thought that Serena Williams had a chance at the Australian Open. What have the critics been saying?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " By all accounts, Tandelaya, this was an incredible and strong and swift performance. Could you tell us just a little bit about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How is she handling this? Is this the same Serena Williams or has maturity become part of the equation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Keep up with them as they come by on the conveyor belt?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Okay. So the bottles go out from the creamery. They go to a store. And say, someone were to pick it up and say, she looks great. I want to give her a call. What would they do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I think I'm checking you out. I see a photograph. Are you blonde and you have a nice big smile?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I don't see what your profile is. What did you say in your profile?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Elen, how many people live in your town?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if you were looking for a date, tonight, say, Friday night, you pretty much know who's available?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any idea is the pool is a bit too small?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What sort of response have you gotten to all this, so far, Elen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the three young women who were attacked, what's the nature of their injuries?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it was that - the statements about hating white people - those were the bases of the hate crime charge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We mentioned the judges are expected to rule tomorrow. Is there a lot of nervousness there now about reaction when that verdict comes in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now in this case in Long Beach, the defendants are all black. They're charged with hate crimes against whites, and there have been some people who've said that's an inappropriate application of hate crime law, that the original intent was to protect minorities. What do you think about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as the country's becoming more and more diverse, are you seeing a change numerically in how these laws are being used?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The healthcare proposal President Bush will put forward tomorrow night is bound to be a controversial one. As Don just mentioned, it would change the way health benefits are taxed. With us to explain more about how that will work and what the political obstacles might be is NPR's Julie Rovner. And Julie, why don't you explain a bit more about what exactly the president's proposal will be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if you look at how this might work over time, would that change the number of people who are affected?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It sounds, Julie, like there will be a fair amount of political push back on this. Why don't you give us some sense of who's lining up for the president's idea and who's lining up against it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why would business be against this, Julie?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the major challenges the new prime minister will face?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what does today's election mean for Serbia's future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the first three years after you came to L.A. in 2002, gang crime fell. Now you were recently quoted as calling Los Angeles the epicenter of the nation's gang crisis. You've had a 14 percent increase in gang-related violence last year. What has changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you had luck when you first came to L.A. in bringing gang crime down. What happened last year that was different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have a particular obstacle to overcome in communities like this? I think of two areas to question you. You know, in Los Angeles, minority communities have a history of mistrusting the police department on the one hand, and then, you know, how hard is it to get officers to go into gang-dominated neighborhoods like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you saying that the LAPD does not have the resources it needs to fight this battle, that you have to call in for federal help?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, you talk a lot about cracking down on these gangs and some of the tools that you'll be using to do that, but what about, you know, an alternative? Are you offering gang members a way out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you describe the scene for us? What's happening there now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any information about who was onboard?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, amid this bad news, there does seem to be a positive development in recent days in Iraq, reports that there's a decrease in sectarian killings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That still sounds like a lot people showing up dead. What do you make of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But yet, the White House is calling for more troops. Is there any indication of where these troops will actually come from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The White House is paying a lot of attention to this region. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was just in Saudi Arabia. Was Secretary Gates there to reinforce her message or perhaps to bring a new one?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you were last deployed in Iraq and what kind of corruption did you witness there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where were you deployed international he country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the two problems that you cite, I'd like to tick through those one at a time if we could. These ghost soldiers, these are non-existent soldiers that appear on the payroll, is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Exactly how does this work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And these so-called ghost soldiers, any idea what kind of numbers we're talking about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the second problem you cite, the smuggling, you say this costs the country $100 million a year. That's a lot of money. What's actually going on there, and who's profiting from this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So who's engaged in this smuggling? Are Iraqi customs officials or other government agents involved in the smuggling?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I would assume that these trucks leaving the country, at some point would have to pass U.S. checkpoints. Is that not an opportunity right there to clamp down on the problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you're talking about 1,400 of what you call elite officials along Iraq's 14 land-border crossings. Where are you going to find these 1,400 people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If the U.S. and Iraqi officials are losing the country's precious resources - as you say, one truckload at a time - what's at stake? What happens if the U.S. or the Iraqi government doesn't figure out a way to tamp down on this problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Luis Carlos Montalvan is an Army captain with the 11th Infantry Regiment. Jury selection began today in the trial of Vice President Cheney's former chief of staff, Louis Scooter Libby. Libby is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in the Valerie Plame CIA leak case. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg was at the courthouse this morning, and she joins us now in the studio. Nina, refresh our memory. Libby is not charged with an unauthorized disclosure of a CIA agent's name, right? Is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So today, jury selection, as we say, began. Can you describe the process? What happened in the courtroom?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how long do we think this voir dire will take place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Were you in court the day that Charles Manson leapt at the judge with that pencil in his hand?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He had a terrifying stare, and it was reported that sometimes he would actually glower at the press corps. Were you ever on the receiving end of one of those stares?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Linda, you also covered the Rodney King trial, the trial of the four police officers who were accused of beating Rodney King and sparked the riots that flared up all throughout the Los Angeles area. What was it like covering that as a reporter but also as a resident of the city?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Linda, why have you stayed on this beat so long?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now when he left, he made no secret of his views. He spelled all this out in a memo. In short, what did he say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So after all that, why did the White House decide to call back Tim Carney? I understand that at one point, the president said give me some names. Why was his name on that list?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tim Carney has a multibillion-dollar budget. Do you have any idea what he plans to do with that? And is that enough to achieve his objective?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You returned to the U.S. this past week saying you had negotiated a 60-day ceasefire agreement for the Darfur region. But soon after, one of the rebel representatives with whom you met denied it in an interview with the Associated Press. What exactly did the parties agree to and why now are they seeming to back away from it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There seems to be some skepticism on the part of these groups that the government is serious. The Justice and Equality Movement has said it cannot agree to a truce until the government stops escalating violence. I'd like to know what you saw when you were in Darfur. Do you have the sense that the government of Sudan is escalating attacks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you did go, you know, in a private capacity with the Save Darfur Coalition. Do you think you succeeded in getting something that American diplomats have not been able to get thus far?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it hard to think about being in a race where you have such high-profile candidates, people like Hilary Clinton and Barak Obama? A Fox News poll recently had you in last place in a potential pool of Democratic nominees. How do you go about getting yourself known? Trips like this to Darfur?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So politically, that was difficult for him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And he stood down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look back at the whole experience with the refugees from Indochina during the Vietnam War era, do you think that the United States has the same responsibility toward Iraqis that the country did back then to the South Vietnamese?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think the U.S. is doing enough to assist those who do need that special protection?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, over the past few days, the secretary has been facing questions also about U.S. intentions toward Iran, specifically after a U.S. attack on an Iranian office in Iraq. Has Rice had anything more to say about that on her current trip?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tomorrow Secretary Rice is scheduled to be in the West Bank. Where does she go from there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Michele, before we let you go, I'd like to ask you about this flap that has been reported between Secretary Rice and Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. When Secretary Rice was testifying during a Senate hearing this past week, Senator Boxer told her that neither of them would pay a personal price for the war in Iraq, that she, Senator Boxer, did not have children or grandchildren in the military and that Secretary Rice had no immediate family. Ms. Rice then later suggested in a New York Times interview that Senator Boxer had dealt a blow to feminism by highlighting Ms. Rice's single status. Has there been any further clarification of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this kind of boots on the ground military solution what's going to be necessary to fight what some in the administration are now calling the long war? That term seems to be replacing war on terror?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How realistic is it to think that recruiters can come up with 92,000 more troops?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you're talking more troops and paying them more money, you're talking about higher costs for U.S. taxpayers, who are already spending billions to cover the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Will the Democratic-controlled Congress be willing to fund this type of military expansion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hello. Chris, I'm going to start with you. You're 19 and the older brother, so let's find out a little bit more about your decision. You enlisted back in August of 2005. Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Bethany, you're 17 and will be graduating from high school in June. Did Chris encourage you to join the Marines to follow in his footsteps?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, you both have enlisted in a part of the military at a time when the country is at war. Is that a factor when you're making your decision? Does it motivate you to either join because you know your country needs you? Or do you stop and think, wait a minute, this is a, you know, a country at war, maybe I don't want to enlist?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How so?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Chris?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that going to Iraq, you will be fighting the people who are responsible for 9/11?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You think they got lucky?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For more now on the ethical debate over the first-of-its-kind embryo bank, we turn to Alta Charo. She's a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin. She joins us now from Madison. And Professor Charo, why has this clinic stoked such a robust ethical debate over reproduction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The San Antonio-based clinic has also shed light on the lack of government oversight and regulation in this area. What are the federal or even state guidelines that govern creating or distributing embryos?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as we're wading through the sort of world of government regulations, in this country's legal for women to make money donating their eggs. It's one of the few industrialized nations that allows such transaction. Men can also donate sperm and receive money for that. What about selling embryos? Is that allowed under the law?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how do you let people know that you're accept pesos? Big sign on the window?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So there at the store, Antonio, it seems like this would present a bit of a challenge, because you need to make change. You have to figure out a - I guess a constantly changing and fluctuation exchange rate. How do you handle that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how is it going so far?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how do you measure success, when you say it's going well, what does that mean? How many customers have you had coming in and using pesos instead of dollars?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you know, that there are those who will say that yes, you're perhaps trying to serve the needs of your customers, but maybe this is really just a publicity stunt?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Antonio Swad is the founder and president of a Dallas-based pizza chain called Pizza Patron. From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Debbie Elliott. This week will mark a turning point in the Iraq war. On Wednesday, President Bush is expected to announce a troop surge, increasing the size of U.S. ground forces in Iraq by as many as 20,000 troops. Democrats on Capitol Hill are vowing to oppose the plan, and we'll hear about that in a few minutes. But first, the plan itself. NPR's Guy Raz covers the military and joins us now in the studio. Guy, what are we talking about here? What exactly is meant by a surge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How will the military go about achieving that number?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Guy, leading up to the president making his announcement of the new strategy, we'd been hearing from the commanders in Iraq, General Abizaid, who's on his way out as head of the U.S. central command, expressing reservations about sending more troops. So had General Casey, who was the Iraq ground commander. He's coming back to Washington now as army chief of staff. Is the president not listening to them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So who's deciding now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have you been seeing, Gwen, as far as the violence on the streets?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Gwen, tell us about the mission of the U.S. assistant secretary of state. What is the U.S. trying to accomplish in Somalia now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The man just appointed as archbishop of Warsaw abruptly resigned today, just as he was supposed to be installed in his new post. The reason: revelations that he had collaborated with Poland's secret police during the Communist era. The resignation of Stanislav Wielgus came as an embarrassment not just for him but for Pope Benedict XVI, who had appointed him. John Allen of the National Catholic Reporter is following the story and joins me now. John, what do we know about the archbishop's relationship with the Communist authorities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, at first, I understand, Wielgus was not admitting this information. What did he say as he was stepping down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John, shouldn't the pope have known about this background before naming him archbishop?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's start with Ohio State. How often does a team start the season ranked number one and make it to this point, still ranked number one and playing for the national championship, trying to go wire to wire?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So are you making any predications here, Bruce?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you plan to seek testimony from Donald Rumsfeld?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There were reports this week from the Wall Street Journal, that as part of President Bush's strategy that he'll be announcing next week, he's going to suggest that billions more go to Iraq, go to Iraqi reconstruction, go to actually the political parties in Iraq. Is that something that your committee would have oversight over?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the oversight and investigation sub-committee that you will chair is under the House Armed Services Committee. But there are reports of other similar investigations and oversight panels under other committees that are being formed right now. Isn't there a risk here, that the Democrats might be on some sort of a partisan witch-hunt?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, could you first quickly describe how you conducted these tests, these broad side simulations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And side impact is, as I understand, important here because U.S. cars and car seats can't be sold unless they meet certain front-end crash standards, but not necessarily true for side impact. Is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you looked at 12 different models of these infant seats, and do I understand this correctly? Only two performed well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I have to stop you there right now, because there's someone who's driving in a car wondering do I have a kid in the backseat right now who's in one of those Evenflo Discovery seats? If they do, what should they do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So in the cases where the car seats failed the test, what happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Kim, your tests seem to point out problems with this latch system, the federally mandated attachment system which is supposed to help parents make sure that seats are actually installed correctly. What's the problem there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, listener Joel Bauden(ph) of New York City took issue with a suggestion that Native-born Americans won't do restaurant work. He writes: I worked in restaurants and I'm proud to say that. I was a student at the time, and it paid my rent and it fed me three meals a day, two of your biggest expenses. It was a smart thing to do. But Pia Moreto(ph) of Orem, Utah, suggested higher wages would solve the problem. She writes: Of course, employers who don't want to pay living wages are going to have a hard time getting employees. A person's dedication to their job is largely based on how much they make. Pay people a decent wage and they will be dedicated - $12-$13 an hour isn't that much anymore. We also heard from many of you about former President Gerald Ford. He died the day after Christmas and was buried yesterday. Charles Stitser(ph) of Richmond, Virginia, wasn't alone in his sentiments. He writes: Gerald Ford was a good man and a dedicated public servant. However, I think they referring to his pardoning of Richard Nixon as healing the country is simply revisionist history. I do not recall feeling healed when Nixon's pardon was announced. In my opinion, this act did not heal anything. In fact, I believe it only served to deepened the divisions between the two parties and undermine the public's respect for our political system. And our story about former first lady Betty Ford's public battle with cancer struck a personal note for Elaine Post(ph) in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994, she writes. Not long after my diagnosis, Mrs. Ford was in Tulsa for a political fundraiser. A dear friend of mine attended the fundraiser and spoke to Mrs. Ford about my diagnosis. Mrs. Ford asked my friend for details and wrote me a note. A short time later, my phone rang and it was Mrs. Ford. She said that she really wanted to speak with me and ask me about my treatment and prognosis. I will always remember her kindness and graciousness, and how she encouraged me to be a survivor.

Today marks exactly one year since lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty. He's at the center of the biggest congressional corruption scandal in years. Democrats ran for office promising to end what they called the Republicans culture of corruption. Here to discuss their reforms is NPR's Peter Overby and Peter, could you tick through what's in these reforms?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you're saying that these new rules would block any kind of cut-rate travel, even if a corporate jet was used and a lawmaker actually reimbursed the company?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now just quickly, Peter, you mentioned the K Street Project. This would prevent the Democrats from essentially doing the same thing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the ban on gifts, the ban on any kind of travel arranged or paid for by lobbyists, the ban on activities that would fall under the so-called K Street Project. How would any of these rules prevent something like the Abramoff scandal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So is this the entire Democratic ethics package?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thomas Jefferson was quite a book collector. Do you happen to know how he acquired this Quran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you just give us a quick description of the book? What's it look like?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Daniel Pinkwater lives in the Hudson River Valley. A legislative commission in New Jersey recommends that the state abolish the death penalty. If the legislature and governor approve, New Jersey would become the first state to abolish capital punishment by legislative action since 1972. The 13-member panel is made of prosecutors, a police chief, members of the clergy, and representatives of families of murder victims. The vote was 12 to one. James Abbott is on the commission. He's the police chief of West Orange, New Jersey. And Chief Abbott, I understand you voted with the 12-member majority to do away with the death penalty in your state. Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it sounds like you're saying that this is a law that's on the books. It's not being carried out so why have it in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I was looking at the findings backing up the commission's decision here, the recommendation. And it gives a number of reasons for deciding to abolish capital punishment. One is that there's no evidence that the death penalty serves a legitimate penalogical intent. That the costs of the death penalty are greater than the costs of life in prison without parole. And then there's also this, which I found the most interesting: increasing evidence that the death penalty is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency. Could you explain that for us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now how is that possible?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As a police chief, do you think that death penalty, no death penalty, does it have a bearing on violent crime?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I gather there's strong opposition to the death penalty in both houses of the New Jersey legislature. And you have the Democratic governor, John Corzine, who has said he would like to carry out what you've recommended here. So do you think this actually will go forward? Will New Jersey abolish the death penalty?"}

With these new adoption standards in China, some prospective parents have decided to look elsewhere. Heather Wareing is a single mother from Farmingville, New York. She adopted her first child from China over two years ago and planned to adopt another until recently. Heather Wareing joins us now. And Ms. Wareing, I understand that as a single parent, you obviously wouldn't qualify under these new rules, but you've decided to press on nonetheless. How have your plans changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you first learned about this, first, how did you learn about it and what was your reaction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But they were rumors at that point. When did you find out that these rules were actually on the horizon, that change was afoot?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Heather, I imagine that it's not so easy to change course like this. The whole process is very arduous. It's very emotional. And you - it sounds like you've invested a certain amount of time and learning about a particular country, its language and its customs. How difficult was it to opt against China and decide instead to pursue an adoption in Vietnam?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Shihab Shamma is with us now in the studio. When I met you at that polling place, I remember so clearly how happy you were. You were almost like a teenager rocking back and forth on your heels. I'm just curious, what are your feelings about Iraq right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We hear so much about the violence in Baghdad. Is there something about life in the city that we don't understand because we're sort of seeing it through a news cycle as opposed to talking to people on a regular basis who actually live in Baghdad, as you do when you talk to your relatives?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to make sure I understand something, because we hear so much right now in this country about the division between the Sunnis and the Shiites and the Kurds. Does your family fall within one of those divisions that we've now come to accept in this country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was that unique to your family or do you think that was a common experience in Baghdad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You seem to be saying that the sectarian conflict is being amplified or misunderstood on this end. But, you know, on the other hand, you have Sunni insurgents that are doing battle against the Mahdi Army, which numbers in the thousands, some say the tens of thousands. That doesn't seem to be an exaggeration?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it that you disagree with the labels that are being used or the degree of sectarian violence? Because you have bands of people who are targeting, executing people all over Baghdad simply because they don't agree with them. If that isn't sectarian violence, what is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Bush has heard advice from several quarters now about change in strategy for Iraq, a way forward in that country. What do you want to hear from the president?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " NPR's Gwen Thompkins joins us from Mogadishu. And, Gwen, tell us about this latest installment with Islamists fleeing Kismayo, what happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, when you talk about divisions within the Islamic Courts, what would those be?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did your readers say of President Bush's handling of the war in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does that tell you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Military personnel tend to be pretty optimistic about their likelihood. They're not trained to say no, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now other than the questions about the war in Iraq and how the president is handling things, you asked a lot of questions just about the general condition of the military and the morale. What did you find?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Since your respondents sent in your answers, President Bush has started talking publicly more about the difficulties he's facing in Iraq and the need to come up with a new plan. Do you think you might have gotten different answers had you sent the poll out today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So let me get this right. You literally chained yourself to the radiator so that you could not leave your house to buy another pack of cigarettes. This just seems a little extreme to me. Did you not hear of, say, the patch or nicotine gum or some of these other avenues?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So here you are. You're - it's day one. You're still in your bathrobe. Your husband locks the chain on your ankle. He leaves for work. You're alone. You're facing your demon. But the first thing you seem to notice is your dirty house, and then all of the sudden the sound of cigarettes are calling you. What was it like that day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's this one part in the book where you're, you vacuum a little bit and you head over to the mantle and you're dusting and you pull up a picture of your son, and that's when you start to really think about what you were doing, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you figure out? How did you tie up what smoking meant to you in your life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I'm sure all of our listeners who are smokers are curious to find out, was that the end? Did you never pick up another cigarette?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. And now for a reaction from the Arab world to the execution of Saddam Hussein, we go to Jordan and Ayman Safadi. He's editor of an independent daily called Al-Ghad. Mr. Safadi, what has been the response thus far from Arab governments?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you mention the fact that this is a Muslim holiday and a holy day. What is the symbolism of having Saddam executed on this day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, Jordan is one of the places where you have seen a huge influx of Iraqis fleeing the violence in their country. Have you heard any reaction from the large exile community there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Executing Saddam now means that he will not be held accountable for much greater crimes like the genocide against tens of thousands of Kurds in the Anfal campaign. Are the Iraqi people now deprived of historical accounting?"}

And I'm going to quote now from the notes that were next to your name. It said you were emerging as a leading black anti-Nixon spokesman. And pardon me for quoting this part of it: has known weakness for white females.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was there ever a sense that when President Ford invited you and others to the White House, that he was somehow reaching out to people who were at one time regarded with suspicion by the Nixon White House?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were actually a member of the Judiciary Committee that voted the articles of impeachment against President Nixon, correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we're reading reports this week from Bob Woodward in the Washington Post, who had several interviews with President Ford in the later years of his life, about what a close personal friendship he had with President Nixon. Was there ever any animosity directed at members of Congress who voted for impeachment from President Ford?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Debbie Elliott. This week Somalia's transitional government, with the help of Ethiopian forces, entered the capital, Mogadishu. Fighters from the Islamic Courts Union, which had ruled the city for months, fled south. Today, Somalia's transitional government announced plans to open a second front against the Islamic Courts Union in the seaport of Kismayu. NPR's Gwen Thompkins is in Mogadishu and joins me now. First of all, Gwen, what is the situation there in the capital today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You say that the city is still in contention?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hostile to the government there, to the transitional government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Gwen, the transitional government is also saying that it plans to move on Islamic Courts Union fighters in Kismayu. Are the Ethiopians expected to help the government in that battle as well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Before pursuing that a bit more, I want to ask you this - some people object to the execution simply on the grounds of their objections to the death penalty. Do you have any misgivings at all about executing anyone at this point in Iraq, including Saddam Hussein?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can't there be, in addition to the trials that have taken place so far, some commission or forum or formal investigation into the Anfal campaign and the attempted genocide of the Kurds, that would establish an historical record and wouldn't necessarily require a continuation of the trial of Saddam Hussein?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was this a case of the Iraqi courts not considering Kurdish sensibilities enough? Do you think that people said Saddam Hussein should not be executed for a campaign against the Kurds because that might not seem as legitimate to the majority Arabs of Iraq, a reason to execute him as a crime against Iraqi Arabs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, let's talk about the complaint that they have issued. You described it as pretrial publicity. What are some of these statements made by the district attorney, by Michael Nifong, that the state bar is now saying were unethical?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I can think of a lot of cases, though, where prosecutors do exactly that. That seems to happen all the time, and ethics complaints aren't filed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is now not a rape case since the charges were dropped, but it is a sexual assault case. What are the chances do you think that this case will actually go forward to trial?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'd like to ask you for your ideas on what your country's role now is, specifically in controlling the capital of Somalia, Mogadishu?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what would your government do about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When do you see Ethiopian troops withdrawing from Somalia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is a story out of St. Petersburg, Florida, that reminded us of a seemingly innocuous but actually very serious aspect of disaster planning and also of a piece of legislation that passed Congress this summer and was signed into law in October. The Florida story involves a pair of dogs who were rescued from St. Bernard Parrish, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina and were then adopted by two Floridians. The Louisiana couple who owned the dogs are suing for custody and yesterday a judge granted them visitation rights while the case is being adjudicated. It is tempting to be dismissive of this, but if you visited New Orleans post- Katrina, you heard endless stories of people who didn't leave and probably should have because they just wouldn't leave the dog or the cat behind. And you saw many, many homes that were evacuated and bore the markings of a visit by the Humane Society of the United States. Checking on abandoned pets was a very big activity there. Well, in response to what happened, Congress took action. With a bipartisanship that eluded them in tackling many strictly human problems, they passed the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act, which President Bush signed. And joining us now is Kim Intino of the Humane Society of the United States. What does the law do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What might people do? Would there be shelters established for animals?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, many people do manage to get out of harm's way when there is a hurricane forecast or flooding, but then comes the question of where will they stay. They have to find the rare motel or hotel where pets are permitted. Does the law in any way address the problem of what you do with the dog once you get out of the city?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what might that entail?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " After Katrina, we witnessed something quite remarkable, which was evidenced in this particular court case in St. Petersburg, which is a lot of pets are rescued. They're taken somewhere else to a shelter and they're in strange places. Is there any principle governing whose dog that is, or whether the dog gets sent back home to Louisiana or stays in Florida? Do we know?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But I were to leave my dog behind in face of some emergency, might I be judged negligent by doing so for having, you know, not taken the dog with me?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Passed rather easily, do we have any idea whether the states and the counties are actually acting on it and living up to the standards in the act?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Speaking of fighters, what if anything do we know about the actual fighting taking place between the Islamists and the forces of the transitional government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First we've heard Gwen and all the reporters there talk about the Islamic Courts Union. What is the Islamic Courts Union?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is an indigenous movement?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the transitional government, I gather, doesn't control much of Somalia. Who is it? Who are the people who run the country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think the Islamic Courts Union has been taken over by really militant Islamists, Jihadists?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So there's been a real change there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We're talking about this today because of the Ethiopian airstrikes. What is Ethiopia's interest in all this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where does the United States stand in all this? And does the U.S. play a role or not play a role that it should be playing? What are we doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The past on the Horn of Africa has been terrible. Do we stand the risk of returning to the days of the 1990s right now when you see what's happening between Somalia and Ethiopia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you had one image of James Brown in your mind performing during one particular song, what is it? What's the one that most enduring for you?"}

Wait. What's that ring-ting-ting-a-ling? As many as 2,000 postal workers have fanned out this Christmas Eve like Santa's elves to get packages to homes around Colorado and Wyoming. They're making Sunday deliveries, hoping to shrink the backlog caused by last week's storms that buried the Rockies. Turns out the snow this Christmas season seems to have fallen on the Denver Airport. There was also some on the Cascade Mountain Range in Oregon and Washington State and central and northern Wisconsin. Otherwise, Buffalo? No. Duluth? Don't need a sled. But wait.

Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas held talks today in Jerusalem in a surprise meeting. The Israeli side agreed to some steps to bolster the embattled Palestinian leader. NPR's Eric Westervelt is following the story in Jerusalem and joins me now. Eric, what exactly did Prime Minister Olmert promise?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how significant are these measures for the Palestinians?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And to Prime Minister Olmert, what could this mean for him domestically, Eric?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, a lot is known about Harry Houdini, and a lot, I think, by now is unknown. It's been 80 years since his death. Would you tell us something about his early life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where did he get that name?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, William Kalush, why do you call Harry Houdini a superhero?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " At the time, people were being defrauded of lots of money all over the country by others who posed as spiritualists who could communicate with the dead, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, could you please describe, I think we should get to at least some of these amazing escape acts that Houdini was primarily known for, and how about choosing the Siberian transport cell which brought him eventually to the attention of Czar Nicholas. What was the Siberian transport cell?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In this carriage, this horse drawn carriage lined with metal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " William Kalash, why do so many people believe that when Ehrich Weiss, a.k.a. Harry Houdini, died in 1926, died in one of his own escape acts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did he die?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Definition required. What is a quinzy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Six feet? My goodness. Does this require a blueprint of some sort?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm okay. What are you working on right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now is this somebody's Christmas present, are they trying to keep it a secret? How do you go about trying to conceal some thing that's pretty obvious?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That might not work, so well, I would think. And are you doing a lot of swing sets at this time of the year?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thank you. Two weeks ago, Raul Castro, Fidel's brother and now the acting president of Cuba, said in a speech that he is open to dialogue with the U.S. government. Did you meet with him?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Given that context, who were you able to meet with and what kinds of progress do you think you made?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Were these officials open to that dialogue with the U.S.? What did they tell you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did anyone you meet with talk about changes that might come to Cuba after Fidel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Bush's position has always been that can't happen until Cuba becomes more Democratic. Where do you disagree with the president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, is this violence different from what we've seen in the past in this region?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And now my conversation with Iraqi Vice President Tareq al-Hashemi, recorded earlier in Washington. What have you told President Bush this week that the U.S. needs to do to help stabilize your country?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " The unending violence has really taken a toll on the Iraqi people. You yourself have been touched. I understand you lost three siblings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I read where you had spoken to a policy group. You were trying to describe for them, if this were happening in America, what it would - in the United States - what it would be like. Can you tell me that analogy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did it get to this level in your country that people are killing one another at such high rates?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Vice President, there are reports that you've been working behind the scenes to form a new parliamentary block that could in fact topple the government. Is that something that you would like to see? Do you think Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki should be replaced?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would you restructure the government, if you could make a plan and present it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've spent time this week in the United States, making your case to different groups and leaders about what is going on in Iraq. What is your main message you're trying to get across to the American people on this visit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, earlier this year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement cracked down on businesses who were hiring illegal workers and then looking the other way. Does - and promised that you would continue to do that. Now that you've had this recent crackdown on the workers themselves, is this signaling a shift in strategy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Explain to me how that worked. These workers actually had a Social Security Number and a name that matched up, but they were not their own. But they were using this to use as their documentation for work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this something new?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did you first discover this whole idea that there was identity theft going on here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there any evidence that this wasn't only identity theft, but that in some cases people were actually selling their identities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, there have been reports in the days following this raid of children left in schools, not knowing where their parents were, and just criticisms of the harshness of this type of a raid. How does the department respond to those?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you satisfied with the cooperation that you've received from Swift?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But otherwise?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Will they be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, how far should employers go to verify documents or the authenticity of a worker's documents? If Swift in fact was cross-checking the government database for these Social Security numbers, you know, where does the responsibility lie. If your system isn't throwing up a red flag that this is a duplicate, what is a company supposed to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why? Is that because of privacy concerns that they're not allowed to give that information to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. Sometimes, the virtual and the real collide - with unintended consequences. Take the Wii. If you're among the unwashed and ungaming, that is spelled W-I-I. It's Nintendo's hot new game console controller. It comes with a device that you strap to your wrist. It's called a Wiimote. And if you're playing tennis on the Wii, you swing the Wiimote like it's a tennis racket, or if you're playing golf, you swing it like a golf club. For the benefit of our merciless production staff, I hooked a couple of virtual tee shots into the ocean this afternoon on a Wii. But at least my triple bogey remained something entirely virtual. Some gamers have let their enthusiasm and their Wiimotes get the better of them leading to a remarkable offer by Nintendo. Sam Kennedy is editor-in-chief of 1up.com, it's a gaming Web site. And, Sam Kennedy, first of all, what is the problem with the Wiimote?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So people see that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, apart from that, apart from the odd broken window or broken television screen, what do you make of the Wiimote and the Wii?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The people who are advocating this say it actually stimulates the economy. I think you don't buy that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you're saying in your case, your employees might make more but they might not work as many hours?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So that raises the question, why are gift cards out there in the open in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there other scams?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Buying gift cards on the net in general - is that well advised?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How big a problem is this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Gift cards are supposed to be convenient but if they become a hassle if they're associated with all kinds of scams and frauds. Will retailers or consumers back away from this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just curious, before we let you go. Do you use gift cards?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has there been any violence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about the government? Has there been any official statement since his death?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell me about your accommodations there. Were you really sleeping in a cell, locked inside?"}

You'll be surprised to know that Texas, Egypt and Birmingham have been taken off the map - of the state of Georgia, that is. The state's department of transportation said the old map was too cluttered and removed nearly 500 small communities to make it easier to read. Some folks who live in those towns aren't so happy about being wiped off the face of the map. One of those little towns is Hopeulikit, Georgia. We've reached a local historian, Smith Banks, just south of Hopeulikit. Mr. Banks, if I drove through Hopeulikit, would I like it?"}

One of the other winners this year is bluesman B.B. King, and I never pass up an opportunity to hear a little from the King of the Blues. B.B. King playing his beloved guitar, Lucille. The Mississippi native embarks on his 60th anniversary tour in January. He is one of 10 Americans set to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony this week. To find out why we hear so much these days about childhood allergies, we called Dr. Hugh Sampson, professor of pediatric allergy and immunology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. First of all, Dr. Sampson, are there really more children who have peanut allergies now, or is this just a function of people are more aware of it, they are reporting it more often now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the explanation for that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So let me just make sure I understand some of the possible explanations for this. When you say the hygiene hypothesis, that means that people are just too clean today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if I, say, got the chicken pox or the measles, that may mean that I am less likely to be allergic to peanuts?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...somewhat obsessed with these days?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. One observation of the Iraq Study Group, in its report that was released this week, was this. There must be a renewed and sustained commitment to a comprehensive Arab/Israeli peace on all fronts. Just as the first Gulf War was followed by a big Middle East peace conference, the one in Madrid in 1991, there should be a similar conference. Richard Haas, who is president of the Council on Foreign Relations, was on the National Security Council staff handling the Middle East back in those days. And Richard Hass, I'd like to talk with you today about the prospects for diplomacy and also the relationship between the Arab/Israeli conflict and Iraq. Do you accept the reasoning that without an Israeli/Arab peace or some progress toward one, you can't get a stable result in Iraq?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'd like to ask you about comment in the report of the Iraq Study Group, this from a - they described this as a leading Sunni politician who told them, if you turn over any stone in Iraq today, you will find Iran underneath. How would you describe Iranian influence in the country right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " On the question of U.S. military forces in Iraq, one thing the Iraq Study Group said was that the Iraqi army actually lacks equipment, logistics and support, and that the United States is going to be turning over more and more responsibilities to the Iraqis than more needs to be done. Would you say, then, that the United States needs to be paying more to support your army than it's doing now?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Once again Senator Levin. From what you have seen of the Iraq Study Group's report, or from as much of it as you've been able to read, is your reaction positive, mixed, or you need to study it some more?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You and other senators were at the White House today. Would you say that President Bush's reaction to the study group's report was as enthusiastic as yours?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's my question to you. It's pretty close; is it close enough that for now, implementation of the Baker-Hamilton recommendations would suffice as far as you're concerned, as opposed to the specific term of four to six months?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For the past several months, we've heard many, many people say, let's wait to hear what Baker and Hamilton say. Over the next coming months, are we going to hear lots of people on the Hill say, implement Baker-Hamilton, implement the Iraq Study Group?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Of the drugs that are out there and that are being advertised heavily in television and people are being told to contact their doctor, are they all essentially the same? Are there different kinds of drugs? Do they work for different kinds of people?"}

This week, Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senate Majority Leader, confounded expectations and said he would not seek the Republican nomination. But on the Democratic side, two Midwesterners seemed to throw their hats in the ring. Aides said Indiana Senator Evan Bayh will make an announcement next week, and on Thursday, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack declared his intention to seek the party's nomination. I spoke with Governor Vilsack earlier today. So you're out of the gates early, the first Democrat to formally announce, and you've already stumped in New Hampshire, you're in Pittsburgh, you're in Des Moines, you're headed to South Carolina and Nevada next. Do you feel you had to do this to get attention in a Democratic field that potentially includes political heavyweights like Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell us the story of how you first came to elective office. It was as mayor of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you were an attorney at the time. Had public office ever occurred to you before that moment?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, Governor Vilsack, some people might think that being from Iowa, the first caucus state, that that would somehow give you a leg up here, but polls indicate that you are even the underdog among the Democratic voters there in Iowa. A Des Moines Register poll in the summer had you running fourth, with only 10 percent of those polled, behind Edwards, Clinton and Kerry. How do you overcome that?"}

I wonder if you share that analysis and if so, where does that leave the Saudis?"}

Insurgent groups in Iraq are now largely self-supporting, according to a U.S. government report obtained by the New York Times. Ransom from kidnappings and sales of smuggled oil are two of the main sources of revenue. The report estimates that $70-200 million a year are raised from these and other illegal activities within Iraq. Joining us now to talk about the leaked report is New York Times reporter John Burns in Baghdad. What does this information reveal about the stability of the insurgency in Iraq?"}

Across Iraq, the latest wave of sectarian violence is claiming more lives. Baghdad has been in a state of lockdown for the past two days as the government tries to keep the country from spiraling into all-out civil war. On Thursday, suspected Sunni fighters killed more than 200 people in a series of orchestrated attacks. In response, Shiite militias went on a rampage yesterday. NPR's Jamie Tarabay joins us now from Baghdad to give us the latest. Jamie, what are things like there today?"}

Many of us spent this holiday week with extended family gathered around the dinner table. For Madhur Jaffrey, having dozens of relatives around the table was an everyday affair. Jaffrey grew up in a large Hindu family in colonial India. The beloved Indian cookbook writer and actress shares her family stories and flavors in a new book, \"Climbing the Mango Trees: A Memoir of a Childhood in India.\" We visited Madhur Jaffrey in her Manhattan apartment to talk about the tastes of her childhood. I'd like to start by asking you about your name. Your name means sweet as honey?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Fred, you mentioned a pattern emerging. This is not the only case where questions have been raised about the Kremlin's possible involvement in a poisoning case. There was the case of Victor Yushchenko, the Ukraine's leader, and the journalist that you mentioned, Anna Politkovskaya. She had said that at one point the Kremlin had tried to poison her. How common is this?"}

And she says it's because he's gone when you wake up, and you're already asleep by the time he comes home, and he says I don't want any part of that, and he goes back in his room again for months.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why? What are their complaints?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do officers and troops interviewed by your paper say that they would like to see Donald Rumsfeld do? I mean, is it his fault that there is this sectarian strife in Iraq?"}

Click on Contact Us and select WEEKEND ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Ted Haggard has been a pastor in Colorado Springs for about 20 years, but his influence goes far beyond that city. NPR's Jeff Brady has interviewed Haggard in the past and followed his career over the past couple of years. Jeff joins us from Denver. Jeff, Ted Haggard arrived in Colorado Springs about 20 years ago. What brought him there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now has Haggard been especially vocal on issues of homosexuality or gay rights?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You have interviewed Ted Haggard in the past and you've seen him responding to these allegations now. What's your impression?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jeff, I asked you about what he has said about homosexuality. The other issue here is the use of methamphetamine. Is that something that figures at all in his ministry? Have you heard him talk about it ever or not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'd like you to put your anticipation of a relatively high turnout for young people in some context. If, say, nearly 30 percent were to vote next week, how would that stack up with more recent mid-term elections than 1982?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But when you compare this group of young Americans with the population at large, what are the notable differences between their opinions and the opinions of the whole population?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Storyteller Kevin Kling lives in Minnesota. At a rally in the Pakistani city of Kahr, some 15,000 armed tribesmen protested against their government and against the U.S. The chanted down with America and down with Musharraf, meaning Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, and long live Osama, meaning Osama Bin Laden. Other similar protests were reported around Pakistan. The cause of these protests is yesterday's Pakistani helicopter attack on a madrassa, a Muslim religious academy in a nearby village. It's believed that about 80 people were killed there. The protestors say those were just teachers and students. The government says it was an al-Qaida training base. Correspondent David Montero of the Christian Science Monitor joins us from the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And David Montero, first what can you tell us about the area of Pakistan where this happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in the attack yesterday, where so many lives were claimed at the madrassa, does the Pakistani government claim that the people whom they were attacking were armed and fighting against them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wasn't President Musharraf rather successfully negotiating agreements with local leaders in some of the tribal areas where the Pakistani government's writ does not run very strong?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do Pakistanis believe that there was any American role whatever in this attack on the target in Pakistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do these protests in the general vicinity in the attack, do they seem to have broader resonance throughout Pakistan? Might it pose any problem for President Musharraf, or is it just one other encounter in the battle against people who don't support his government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Should Iraqis today look at their towns and cities and say from the standpoint of security/governance/infrastructure that the reconstruction of their country is going well?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How big a problem is corruption? You acknowledge it's a difficulty. How big a problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Low level, mid level, high level - who is corrupt in the ministry?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There've been some disputes over just how much progress has been made in getting electricity and water, potable water, to people in Iraq. Right now, can you say that more people today have electricity to their dwelling and potable water than did before 2003, or is it still fewer Iraqis today than before the war?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are people being arrested?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is that loud noise we keep hearing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Bottle rockets as in the firework bottle rocket that I think of, or as in a Molotov cocktail?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Lourdes, the protest here has been going on for months, but it has escalated since Friday, when three people were killed, including an American journalist. Can you give us the background leading up to this conflict?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the Democratic Republic of Congo today it was mostly peaceful for the runoff presidential election. The race is between President Joseph Kabila and vice president and former rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba. The presidential contest is the first free election in Congo in more than 40 years. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton joins us now from the capital, Kinshasa. Ofeibea, what was the scene at the polling stations you visited today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, when are these results expected to be in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Today, Reuters is reporting some violence and that even government officials blocked roads and kept voters from the polls outside of the capital. What are you hearing about those reports today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So even though right now there's all kinds of Halloween stuff out there trying to grab our attention, you're going to scare us in a way that we might not be ready for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Debbie Elliott. In Iraq today, armed men kidnapped nearly a dozen Iraqi soldiers and four civilians were killed in a roadside bombing. The U.S. military announced the death of another Marine yesterday, raising the death toll for U.S. troops this month to 98. The spike in casualties has led to increasingly sober assessments from the U.S. military. General William Caldwell, the chief military spokesman in Iraq, recently described the violence in Baghdad as disheartening. The tone began to shift this summer when General John Abizaid, chief of the U.S. Central Command, warned that Iraq could move toward civil war. A reporter for the Army Times newspaper writes this week that the Army brass are trying now to preserve their credibility and insulate themselves from blame. That reporter, Sean Naylor, joins me now. Sean, would you say that the assessment by commanders is something that their attitudes really are changing, or they're getting frustrated, or are they just being more candid with the public now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think that's happening now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, just this week, during his news conference, President Bush said that if General Casey said he needed more troops for victory, that he'd send more troops. You know, how do you interpret that kind of a statement?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you have in store for us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And I understand that Chris Joyce is going to be exploring the industrial sphere. What exactly is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the articles in this book date back to the 1960s, but there's one article in particular that dates back to those ragtag days. It's call The Game That Was, and it's by Myron Cope. It's the set of oral histories from some of football's pioneers, and I'd like for you, if you would, to read for us from one of those, the one about Ed Healey?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, fear aside, we're now going to spend a few minutes on what Halloween is really all about - costumes. Well, maybe candy comes first, but costumes are very, very important, at least a close second. And to help you navigate this final weekend rush at the party stores or perhaps at the supermarket, we have brought in an expert. Welcome by phone, Laura Bennett, who was the runner up in the hit Bravo cable TV show Project Runway. Hi, how are you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Fine. You are the mother of five, expecting Number Six. Are you doing something for your kids for Halloween this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But how scary can a, you know, three and a half foot tall child really be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that something that's actually on the market?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, some other Project Runway folks worked with NPR.org, our Web site, to put together some suggestions for costumes, and in fact, our listeners can go online and see what those look like. One involved a parent who dresses all in blue holding a blue sheet, and then the child essentially just wears all black and dances around listening to an iPod. It's a takeoff on an Apple ad, in other words. They sort of act - it's a living tableau of the Apple ad. Have you ever been able to come with an idea, at least, which obviously your children would reject, of some ensemble idea for Halloween?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does what's scary change a great deal with fashion, do you think? Are there things that are just too tacky to be scary in the 21st Century, so you don't do them, or is it the good old fashioned ghosts and goblins and spider webs and bats?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The president employed such phrases today as: We learned some key lessons, we overestimated, we did not expect. He spoke of some past setbacks, of some Iraqi forces that have behaved below expectations. It's the vocabulary of humility. Do you welcome that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But the president said we are pressing Iraq's leaders to take bold measures to save their country, and we're making it clear that America's patience is not unlimited. Isn't that exactly what Democrats say they would be telling the Iraqis?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But when President Bush was pressed at his news conference today about what he would do if the Iraqis didn't live up to these demands, if they didn't perform better in the field and make political deals - and he wouldn't say -I'm going to make those things happen is what he said. What would Democrats do? If you're concerned about Prime Minister Maliki living up to these expectations, what's the alternative?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, since the president says that's what he's doing, have we reached a point where the differences between Democrats and the administration over Iraq are more about how the U.S. got to the point that we're at right now than over how we proceed from this point to the future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are Democrats obliged to have a position, to have a plank about Iraq, rather than to have several different positions on what we should do now, apart from being against what the administration's doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lennard Davis is the author of The Disability Studies Reader and Bending Over Backwards: Essays on Disability and the Body. We read today of a contracts case in Canada that involved the cable company, Rogers Communications, and a telephone company, Bell Aliant. An issue was Roger's use of Bell Aliant's telephone polls and Bell Aliant's desire to get out the deal. Now even though a good Canadian telephone poll case has a certain compelling character to it no matter, the reason that we bring this one to your attention is the principle that decided it. Canada's telecommunications regulator made English teachers all over North America proud by ruling that it all hinged on the use of a single comma, a comma that according to the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail cost the cable company more than $2 million Canadian. Richard Janda is a professor of law at McGill University in Montr\u00e9al and joins us now. Welcome to the program, Professor Janda. And you are familiar with this case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the lesson you give law students about this case?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're saying in effect the top three issues for the GOP this fall are the war on terror, the war on terror and the war on terror?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How, then, do you read this - how do you look ahead to the election in terms of Iraq policy. If the Republicans maintain the majorities on the Hill, it's a ratification of the Iraq policy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mean the one Hungarian speaking intelligence agent at the U.S. legation in Budapest was essentially doing consular work at the - because he could speak the language?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of the big issues in all this was what did the Hungarian revolutionaries want? Would they have settled for a neutrality like Austrian neutrality, which had been negotiated in the previous couple of years? It was just the year before when U.S. and Soviet troops all withdrew from Austria. Was it necessary for them to become a Western state, to become a NATO ally? What was their agenda?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Having experienced the uprising as a young man in Budapest, and you spend many years reexamining what happened. But now with 50 years hindsight, what strikes you as the thing that would've been most surprised to young Charles Gati in Budapest back in 1956 which is a great shock to learn that you now know to be true?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look all around the country at the referenda and initiatives that are on the ballot, what is most common? What's the big one this year?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And this is a reaction to the Supreme Court ruling on eminent domain, I'd assume?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And this year, gay marriage ban measures?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There seems to be some conflicting conventional wisdom about whether if there is a very contentious issue, a question or referendum initiative on the ballot, whether that really does bring one group of voters out to the polls in much greater numbers and whether it really does benefit the candidate who shares their view. I've seen studies which suggest that really isn't the case and others who insist that it obviously is. What's your sense?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The issues that you've talked about are pretty much recognizable hot button issues. Are there any real surprises, I mean questions that are just much more obscure than that?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tom, the president was interviewed on ABC's This Week this morning and he said that his administration is constantly adjusting its tactics in Iraq. Let's listen to how he answered when asked if the U.S. strategy was working. President GEORGE W. BUSH: If it's not working, our commanders change it. And there's progress being made on the political front. There's some progress being made on the security front in terms of getting more Iraq units. Eventually it's going to be up to Iraq to defend herself. Tom, as we just said, you're embedded with American units and they go out on missions with Iraqis. Has there been progress towards this day when Iraqis can defend themselves?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Thomas, we've been reporting, President Bush conferred yesterday with his top military and civilian policy makers, and today the New York Times reports that the administration has agreed to a timetable for the Iraqi government to reach certain benchmarks. Now, a spokesman later denied this. Can you tell us anything about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you respond when President Bush says he's not going to cut and run? That's a very powerful term. It's potent language. And the administration would argue that talking about certain types of redeployment, withdrawing to Kuwait, say, really amounts to cutting and running?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Congressman Ike Skelton, you very likely could become the next chairman of the House Armed Serviced Committee after the November election. Would a Democratic controlled House continue to support funding for the war and the troops at the levels requested by the president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would there be hearings to examine some of the failures?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tom, St. Louis was in the World Series two years ago. You reported on that, and they were swept by the Boston Red Sox. I'm sure they're not just planning on standing there. What do you think the strategy is going to be for St. Louis?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned New York. Doesn't post-season play thrive on the fact that there's a lot of unpredictability?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Brokenhearted. Well, it's been such a colorful week for baseball. Do you think that this series is going get a lot of national attention?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The CD is called Delirio. Our critic is Tom Manoff. Yesterday, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote of the current violence in Baghdad. What we're seeing there seems like the jihadist equivalent of the Tet offensive. That was a series of attacks by the Vietcong, the Vietnamese guerilla force that started on a lunar New Year holiday, Tet, at the end of January 1968. The U.S. said Tet was a last gasp for the Vietcong, inflicting damage but achieving no objectives. But many Americans saw it as disproof of Washington's prior claims of success, and public support for the U.S. war policy in Vietnam declined. Well, yesterday George Stephanopoulos of ABC News was interviewing President Bush in a not-yet-broadcast interview and he asked if the president agreed with Tom Friedman that the current violence in Baghdad was the Iraqi equivalent of the Tet offensive. The president said this. President GEORGE W. BUSH: He could be right. There's certainly a stepped up level of violence, and we're heading into an election. Well, Andrew Kohut has been studying American popular opinion since the days of the Tet offensive and continues to do so at the Pew Center. And we thought Andy Kohut would be the best person to answer of this question. Andy, in 1968, first of all, what did the Tet offensive do to U.S. public opinion and support for the Vietnam War?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Andy Kohut is director of the Pew Research Center. We've been talking about comparisons between the offensive underway in Baghdad today and the Tet Offensive in Vietnam in 1968. More now on politics in Ohio, where there are races both for governor and also for senator. And there are some new polls that should be very worrying for the GOP. Peter Brown works at the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, which has done some of the Ohio polling. And Peter Brown, we just heard a clip for Republican candidate for governor, Ken Blackwell. Your poll shows him not only trailing, but trailing by even more than he was trailing a couple of weeks ago. That seemed almost impossible. What's happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Sherrod Brown says he voted against going to war in Iraq and if Senator DeWine have been doing his job on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, he says, we wouldn't be in Iraq. How big and issue is Iraq for voters in Ohio in that race?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in those proceedings what was the role of the military as opposed to the CIA or other agencies of the U.S. government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in looking back at those proceedings, remind us, what have Democrats and civil liberties groups had to say about that system?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do we now know that these military commissions go forward, or will there be more challenges? And if they do, what are the lessons learned that might be applied in this next round?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you know about this deal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If we were to visit a Chinese Wal-Mart, would we - after making allowances for those of us who can't read any Chinese - would we by the look of the store and the goods that are on sale, would we recognize it right away and say, oh, it's just like a Wal-Mart back in the U.S.? Or is it so Chinese-tailored that it would look very different?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look generally at Wal-Mart's ventures in retailing overseas, what's the picture? Is it uniform success? Have there been failures? Are there some countries where they do well and others where they've generally struck out?"}

From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. Civil Rights attorney Lynne Stewart was sentenced today to 28 months in prison. She had been facing up to 30 years. Stewart was convicted in 2005 of aiding terrorists by allowing her client, the blind Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, to communicate with a reporter from prison. NPR's Margot Adler joins us now from outside the courthouse in New York. And, Margot, what was the reaction outside the courthouse after the judge issued that sentence?"}

Chuck Hagel of Nebraska told CNN Late Edition that Americans won't want to keep troops in the middle of a civil war. And on CBS's Face the Nation, the chairman of Armed Services Committee, John Warner of Virginia, said that in the past week there has been an exponential increase in the killings and savagery in Iraq. Hundreds of Iraqis and more than 50 U.S. troops have been killed just this month. Brigadier General Dana Pittard is commander of the Iraq Assistance Group, which assists and trains Iraqi troops. General Pittard says the number of attacks against U.S. forces in four troubled provinces is as high as it's ever been. I spoke with him earlier today from Camp Victory in Baghdad. Sir, I read somewhere that there's an attack almost every 15 minutes. Does that square with your own intelligence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " General Pittard, I understand that U.S. forces say that 300,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained. Now, that would combine both the police and army troops. How many are you actually able to put under command and in the field at any one time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have been your successes, would you say, and what are some of your remaining frustrations? I realize you've just been there since July. It's not a huge amount of time, but it's your third tour. So what's coming along well and what makes you smack your hand against your forehead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This week, General Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said that the Pentagon's making plans based on the assumption that U.S. forces are going to have to remain at these current levels beyond 2010. Does that mean that American forces are encountering more trouble than had been expected in trying to get the Iraqi troops to stand up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you would say he's just being proactive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, talking about fighting a counter-insurgency war, the head of the British army said last week that British troops should leave Iraq soon because their continued presence was making the situation worse and creating resentment. Could you react to his statement, please?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how soon do you think Iraq will have its own army entirely capable of fighting insurgencies inside its own territory?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And now to politics in Ecuador, where voters went to the polls today to choose a new president. Exit polls show the country heading to a run-off between a wealthy businessman and a young economist who draws his inspiration from Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, speaking of multiplicity of lives and connecting to the past, you've had quite a multiplicity of lives in one life yourself. You're a distinguished poet. You've written a memoir about your time as a Sandinista. You've met Fidel Castro. Politics and intrigue have been a big part of your life but not exactly the kind of court intrigues that you, I think, elaborate on very well in here. Do you see any sort of connection?"}

Or did they make her unstable by isolating her for over 40 years and even by beating her and whipping her? I mean it's a horrible story in that sense. Do you think that she really had a genetic mental illness?"}

More on that now from Robert Kaplan, national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, who wrote about North Korea in an article in the October issue of the magazine. It's called When North Korea Falls. And Robert Kaplan, I gather one very important element in China's view of what happens in North Korea is the possibility of North Korea falling?"}

North Korea would be held fully accountable. What does that mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So far, some have criticized the administration's policy toward North Korea as amounting to big denunciations - North Korea's in the axis of evil -but a little softer on action. What actually are we threatening here if there were a distribution of weapons?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've been dealing with the North Koreans for years now to no avail, and today the U.S. proposed stringent sanctions. Do you get the sense that that would be enough, that that would deter the North Koreans from their present nuclear course?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I've heard it said that if China were simply to say because of your actions in North Korea, we're going to cut off economic assistance to you, and by doing so, thereby risk instability in North Korea, which they're not obviously very interested in doing. But that might have real resonance in North Korea. That might really have an effect on them. Is that true?"}

I'm Jacki Lyden. Debbie Elliott is away. U.S. casualties in Iraq are up sharply. Since the beginning of this month, 29 have been killed. And last month, 776 American troops were wounded, the highest monthly toll in two years. On Thursday, Senator John Warner, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, warned that the situation in Iraq was drifting sideways, and Senator Warner, who is just back from a brief visit to Baghdad, said the U.S. should consider a change of course if the violence does not diminish. Joining us to talk about the reasons for this spike in American casualties is retired Army Colonel Douglas MacGregor, a decorated combat veteran. While still in uniform early in the war, he advised Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Colonel MacGregor, thanks for being here. Are we seeing rising casualties simply because American forces have now stepped up the effort to secure Baghdad?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you spoken to any commanders who are recently returned from this battle theater?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me ask you. The other point of bringing more troops from Mosul and other places into Baghdad City was to try to reduce the flow of insurgents into the city from outlying areas. Has that, in the judgment of those you've talked to who've just returned, been effective?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But Gans says low primary turnout doesn't speak to what's likely to happen in November. If you want some indication of what might happen next month, Gans offers a quick history lesson. Polling suggests that this year's elections are likely to shift the balance of power from Republicans to Democrats in at least one house of Congress and in many states. The last two midterms that brought a significant shift in power from one political party to the other were 1982 and 1994. And how was primary turnout then?"}

A secret report by a senior U.S. military intelligence official has some sobering news about Iraq. It concludes that U.S.-led forces will likely not secure Anbar Province in western Iraq unless there are major changes to operations there. The outline of the classified assessment was first reported by The Washington Post and now has been confirmed by NPR. Joining us from the Pentagon is NPR's John Hendren. And John, what does this report say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the reaction within the Pentagon to this?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " The comments of New York architect Hugh Hardy. According to John T. Edge, the cure for what ails you is cured meat. John T. is our curator of all things culinary and he's been out on the trail tasting handmade salamis from Oxford, Mississippi to New York City to Seattle, Washington. That's where we tracked him down for this week's food moment. John T., I understand you ate more than your share of salami last night. Mr. JOHN T. EDGE (Southern Foodways Alliance): I did indeed, and I'm drinking a lot of water this morning. We should explain that you were at a restaurant called Salumi?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Salumi is the Italian word for salami. What's it like there? Do you feel like you've stepped into the Old World?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " It looked like it would be fun to cook with. John T., are we on the cusp of something new here? A bona fide trend? Are salami tastings in the offing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if the president gets a bill out of Congress that says you can proceed, what happens next? Do you then bring a challenge on behalf of Salim Ahmed Hamdan and go to court challenging that law?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The president says that the Supreme Court cited Common Article III of the Geneva Conventions, which is too vague, he said. That Congress should spell out what it is that is an affront to dignity or a violation of the kind of processes alluded to in that article. What's your understanding of what the article precludes in the way of a trial?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well is, for example, aggressive but not physically coercive questioning, perhaps even with some threat implied by questions, is that illegal under Common Article III?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm confused though as to in what way the president is being anything less than respectful of the Supreme Court here. He says, they threw out the system that I had proposed. The Supreme Court therefore has ruled that out. So I'm going to Congress to get a law to set up something else. Isn't that exactly what the Supreme Court told him to do?"}

The hurricane lost strength as it lashed Haiti today. Its winds are now reported to be about 60 miles an hour. The storm's heavy rains have triggered some coastal flooding in Haiti and dangerous mudslides are possible on the Caribbean island. Forecasters predict tropical storm Ernesto will regain its strength as it moves toward the Florida Gulf Coast later this week. In the meantime, Ernesto is expected to cross over Cuba. Evacuations are under way in eastern Cuba and the Florida Keys, where officials today asked tourists to leave. Governor Jeb Bush has declared a state of emergency.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, who ran Al Gore's campaign in 2000. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel. The Food and Drug Administration today approved the sale of Plan B, the morning after contraceptive pill, without a prescription but only to those 18 and over. Younger teenagers will still need a doctor's prescription to access the drug. The emergency contraceptive can prevent most pregnancies if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The FDA's decision caps a three-year fight over teen sex, abortion and the intersection of science and politics. And with us by phone to discuss today's announcement is NPR's Julie Rovner, who's followed this fight from the beginning. Julia, let's start with today's announcement. Obviously, with this drug, the sooner you take it the better. So how much easier will this make it? JULIA ROVNER reporting: Well, yes. Obviously time is of the essence and that's the main reason for this push to make it available without prescription. The drug can actually work for up to five days but it's most effective if taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex. Now what the FDA has done today will make it somewhat easier to get the pill quickly, but not as easy as perhaps other over the counter medications. It won't, for example, be sold in convenience stores or in grocery stores that don't have pharmacies. In fact, it will only be sold in places where there is a healthcare professional on duty, which would mean pharmacies or health clinics. And it will be kept not out but behind the pharmacy counter so you can only get it when the pharmacy counter is open, and you can only get it if the pharmacist is willing to sell it to you. And which we've seen over the last year or two, there are a small but growing number of pharmacists who have moral objections to this medication. They say that it can cause very early abortion, even though it is not the abortion pill. It is considered a contraceptive by the FDA. So it will make it easier but it will not take down all of the barriers. But apart from that argument about abortion, there were other objections that were made against making the drug more easily available, no?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we heard for some time now that this has not been a scientific decision that was made today, but rather there was political pressure from conservatives that stalled approval of Plan B. What then can we conclude from today's announcement that it's going to be approved over the counter for those 18 and over?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Julie, just very briefly, what else if anything in a pharmacy is available over the counter for those over 18 but only by prescription for those under 18?"}

A federal appeals court ruled last week in the strange case of a motorist, a cooler full of cash and the scent of narcotics. Emiliano Gomez Gonzolez of California was driving a rented car in Nebraska when state troopers stopped him for speeding. A trooper asked to search the car and found inside a cooler on the back seat bundles of cash totaling $124,700, which the troopers seized. This was in May 2003. Mr. Gonzolez has not been charged with any offense but a drug sniffing dog named Rico picked up the scent of drugs on the money and on the rental car. The long and the short of it is this - Mr. Gonzolez is a free man but he's out $124,700. The troopers seized the cash and the appeals court ruled that they had the right to do so. Roger Goldman is a professor of constitutional law and criminal procedure at St. Louis University Law School.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You can hear more of Allan Harris' Studio 4A performance at npr.org. As the United Nations wrestles over the draft agreement, fierce fighting continues in the region. Since the fighting started three weeks ago, hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon and dozens in Israel. Earlier, I spoke with two leading experts about the large number of civilian casualties and what it means legally and militarily. Sir Adam Roberts is an expert on the laws of war. He teaches at Oxford University and was at BBC Studios in Oxford. Retired Major General Robert Scales, the former commandant of the Army War College was here in our studio. Professor Roberts, we'll start with you. Israel has come under a lot of criticism for the civilian casualties that have been caused by its bombings in Lebanon. But Israel says Hezbollah guerrillas have been hiding among the civilians. Under the laws of war, does this justify the attacks on Lebanese villages and population centers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " General Scales, let's look at the case of Israel and its targets in southern Lebanon, where civilians are killed, but Israel says it's because Hezbollah is hiding behind civilian populations. What do you think of Israel's tactics here? Maj. Gen. ROBERT SCALES (Retired): Well, I think the most important thing is the fact that these wars are fought to shape perceptions, to mold opinions, to influence the attitudes of people, not just in the region but globally. And if that's the strategic objective, then extraordinary measures should be taken to avoid killing civilians because it's the humanitarian right thing to do, but also at the strategic level, it has enormous consequences for the state. So when you use something like air power, which has always been a blunt instrument - even so-called precision munitions are still munitions that if they're delivered in the wrong place are precisely wrong - you run the risk of excessive casualties among the civilians and not much of a strategic payback in terms of your ability to lessen the power of Hezbollah. And it's a dilemma that the Israelis are dealing with every day. How do you avoid that? Maj. Gen. SCALES: The first way you avoid it is to limit the use of very, very large instruments of killing. If a soldier sees the target, if someone shoots at him and he engages that target with either his own weapons or supporting fire, he can be relatively assured that that's not an innocent civilian, that it's Hezbollah. That the lowest collateral damage, increases damage to the enemy, but at the same time it also puts your own forces at risk. It's a balance. Professor Roberts, when you have one entity, Hezbollah, which is continuing to fire rockets into Israel that are aimed at civilian targets, and then on the other side you have Israeli bombs that are also killing civilians, although not directly aimed at them on purpose, you know, what is the difference when you talk about the laws of war between what Hezbollah is doing and what Israel is doing?"}

He joins us on the line. Hello, there. Thanks for speaking with us. Mr. I. BEVERLY LAKE, JR. (Former Chief Justice, North Carolina): Hello. Thank you for having me. Justice Lake, I imagine a judge's biggest fear is sending the wrong person to prison. Was there something you saw from the bench that led you to start working on this?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " But this is where things get complicated and it all has to do with sequencing. You've got the United States seeming to be, at least, at odds with its European allies, who are lining up behind France. France is saying first, an immediate halt to the fighting, then a negotiated cease-fire and then a political agreement, and only then will an international force go in. The United States is saying what seems to be the reverse of that sequence. How do you bridge that divide?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'd like to ask you about the long-term effects of what's going on now. The longer that this fighting continues, the more loss of civilian life that we see. Do you not fear that there's a climate being fostered where extremism will increase, where support for Hezbollah will increase, including among people who would never have supported Hezbollah before, like secular Shiites in Lebanon, and at the same time that anger toward Israel and the U.S. will increase?"}

MARA LIASSON reporting: Well, Democrats scrambled the schedule a little bit. They've added a couple of states to that sacred ground on the calendar, which are the early weeks in January and February, that until now were considered the sole and exclusive province of Iowa and New Hampshire. What they've decided to do is let Nevada hold a caucus after the Iowa caucuses and before the New Hampshire primary.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " A soundclip from R. Pace in Grand Junction, Colo. He tells us that although adults get best results out of the tub, his uncle had the Stradivarius of tubs, a model raised on legs that allowed him to use his whole body to generate sounds. If you have a sound that you want to share with America, call us at 202-408-9576. To hear previous soundclips, go to npr.org. That phone number is there too. As we mentioned, it's been five years since President Bush outlined the limits on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research. Since then many researchers have protested the restrictions, but at the same time some embryonic stem-cell research has continued. Joining us to talk about the state of stem-cell research is NPR science correspondent Joe Palca. Welcome. JOE PALCA reporting: Thank you. Joe, I understand that you were at the International Stem-Cell Society's annual meeting earlier this month. What were scientists at that meeting saying about these restrictions on research?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There were a lot of dire predictions when these restrictions were announced that top scientists would flee the country, go places where stem-cell research was not restricted as it was going to be in the United States. Did that ever actually happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For all the promise of embryonic stem-cell research, how close have researchers come to actually finding cures from these cells?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are they closer on any one particular disease than any other?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, scientists can still use private money to work on embryonic stem-cell lines that haven't been approved for federal research and federal funds. Is that enough?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora has indicated he's prepared to take control of all the Lebanese territory, including Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Lebanon. What did he mean by that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You say it's not likely that the Lebanese government could take control of southern Lebanon from Hezbollah. Why is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, went on television today and made an address. He talked about how his guerillas quote have complete strength and power, and added that as long as the enemy acts without limitations it is our right to act similarly. He also talked about the firepower that Hezbollah has. It almost sounded as if he were flexing his muscles and warning Israel that there's more to come. What can you tell us about his intent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's behind that rise?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look at all of the health problems facing the world today, how do you rank tobacco? Where does it sit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So smoking is no longer only accessible to people who have wealth?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The World Conference on Tobacco or Health meets every three years. And I notice on this year's agenda there was an actual, you know, agenda item called the end game. What is the end game? What do tobacco control advocates want to see? A world with no cigarettes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We do. Now the last time you and I spoke, it was springtime and you were singing the praises of catfish. So now it's carp?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With your baits?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Huh?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Doughballs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you just pull a little hunk out of the bag and put it on your hook?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what does it taste like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, how big are carp? Where do you catch them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For much of the Bush administration, it seemed that U.S./Russian relations were rather cordial, and that these two leaders were almost friendly in their relationship. But in the last couple of years, the language of the Bush administration has begun to harden in relation to Russia. And in the last few months, it seems that that tension has escalated even more. What changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned that Russia is taking a more assertive approach in foreign policy now. What is happening to make that possible?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand he'd found what he considered the original grapevine?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did he find them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So he gathered up these grapevines from the Middle East, brought them back to California, and what did he do with them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Prof. Olmo made this discovery in the 1940s, but he actually began creating varieties and teaching in the 1930s. What would you say were his main contributions to California grape growing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do we have him to thank for Chardonnay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did he love a glass of wine or was this more about the science for him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of a teacher was he?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did that happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So they managed to score two runs just by getting bases without getting a hit and then stealing home to win the game?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, this must have been sort of an odd moment after this game in the locker room. What did you tell your team?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " During the school year you're an assistant coach at Santa Clara University in California. Did you call anybody back home to explain this wild game?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ambassador, what immediate steps do you think the United States could take or should take?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said that the United States should call for an immediate cessation of hostilities. The president has not gone that far, he has said Israel has the right to defend herself. He has not joined in Lebanon's call for a ceasefire. Do you think he should be going farther, then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think, given the influence of Iran and Syria on Hezbollah, that it would be time for the United States to sit down with those countries and try to get some concessions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think that the U.S. involvement in Iraq, now, is complicating this in a fundamental way? In other words, that its influence as a possible broker of a deal, is lessened because of our involvement in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This case centers on the 1999 killing of Kenneth Wilson, a black man who was murdered while looking for a parking spot there in Highland Park. Could you tell us about that case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What else was going on in the neighborhood, beyond this one killing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where is Highland Park?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is the intent here to do what police there in Los Angeles have been trying to achieve for years, essentially to break up the Avenues gang for once and for all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as we've heard, a number of roads and bridges also were bombed. As you've made you way around the country today, what effects of those attacks have you seen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There were two large families that were killed in the Israeli attacks. Did you talk to anyone where those families were hit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to ask you a question that I asked yesterday to an editor in Beirut, the question being will the Lebanese ultimately, if not now, ultimately hold Hezbollah responsible? In other words, could there be a backlash for what's happened here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. Valerie Plame and her husband, Joseph Wilson, have filed a lawsuit against Vice President Dick Cheney and other high-ranking White House officials. The White House leaked Plame's identity as an undercover CIA agent to members of the media. The lawsuit accuses the administration of conspiring to sabotage their civil rights. NPR's Ari Shapiro joins us. And, Ari, what does this lawsuit say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, we mentioned Vice President Cheney, who else is named in this lawsuit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, the plaintiffs are saying the White House conspired against them. What are they saying was the nature of that conspiracy and how they'd prove it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now how do this lawsuit coincide, if it does at all, or connect with the investigation brought by the special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well it is an amazing thing. Let's talk a bit about this. The pain as he's described it is unbelievable what he is riding through. How does he do it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Frankie, what are you looking forward to in the days to come in the tour?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, who else are good contenders here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I do want to ask you one question about Lance Armstrong. You were subpoenaed in a case, and in a deposition you said that you heard Lance Armstrong acknowledge that he had used drugs, testosterone, human growth hormone and EPO. This was back in 1996. Armstrong has been all over the media in the past couple of weeks denying that that ever took place. Do you still stand by what you said?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Frankie Andreu was providing commentary on the Tour de France for the Outdoor Life Network. He spoke with us from the top of the mountain in Pla de Beret in northern Spain, where today's 11th stage ended. And again, Floyd Landis, an American, has taken the yellow jersey. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. The anti-terrorist squad of the police department in Mumbai, India today named two suspects in Tuesday's commuter train bombings. Nearly 200 people were killed in those attacks in Mumbai, also known as Bombay. Police have rounded up and detained hundreds of people for questioning. Somini Sengupta is in Mumbai covering the story for the New York Times. And Somini, what can you tell us about these two suspects?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned the group Lashkar-e-Taiba. Has any group claimed responsibility for these attacks, whether Lashkar-e-Taiba or anyone else?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, who else - if it weren't one of these radical Islamic groups - who else might be responsible? Where would suspicion turn?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I mentioned that hundreds of people have been taken in for questioning now by police. What more can you tell us about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned that it was the first class compartments of these trains that were targeted. These are trains that service the financial center of Mumbai. Are authorities reading anything into that? Does it fit with any pattern of rhetoric say, from any groups in India - that that might be a target?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's been two days now since these attacks took place. When you talk to people in Mumbai, especially commuters, what do they say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can you tell us about reaction among the Lebanese people, first to the capture of the two Israeli soldiers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But people didn't think that Hezbollah would make good on their pledge?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Israeli army chief of staff has said that the Israeli's military is going to turn back the clock in Lebanon by twenty years, meaning targeting infrastructure. If power is cut, if water is cut, if basic services are eliminated in parts of Lebanon, will the Lebanese people look at that and say, you know, Hezbollah is ultimately responsible for this because of what they did, because they captured those soldiers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you expect to see deeper incursions into Lebanon by Israeli forces?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've been at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings that Ari Shapiro was just reporting on, what was striking to you, there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What you also heard in today's hearing, is the American spirit of debate. The Senators are very divided on this issue, do you think in the end, that Congress will come up with a system that will ultimately give your client what he's been seeking - a fair trial?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'd also like to get your thoughts on this announcement from the White House. As we reported, the White House announced that Article Three of the Geneva Convention applies to your client and many other detainees, how does that change your legal strategy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And just quickly, before we let you go, do you think that today's announcement means that Guantanamo Bay will continue to function as a prison?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do think the teams were well matched?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you think this match will stack up against other World Cup matches you've seen? Do you think it was a fitting finale? Or was it a bit of a letdown going to the penalty kicks and the shootout?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Rob, as the game went into overtime and then the shootout, were the fans you were with getting a little worried?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you find?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, it's not clear from the study whether you think that these findings reflect that watching The Daily Show is a good thing or a bad thing. Which is it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is a lack of trust in political institutions necessarily a bad thing for democracy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think that watching The Daily Show led some of these students to have more confidence in their political intelligence? Do you think they are actually learning more about the political system by watching this program?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did it work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Professor Baumgartner, have you heard from Jon Stewart since you published this study?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, referees have to make these decisions in a split second. You know, you're right there. It's the heat of play. How do you decide or how do you know if a player's try to fake you out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you watching?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, just this week the head of FIFA, which is the International Soccer Federation that runs the World Cup, said that this practice of faking an injury is cheating and needs to be addressed. Do you agree?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is your current estimate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That range, between 39,000/43,000, that's quite a large chasm; what accounts for that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you know if they're a civilian or if they're an insurgent or a combatant?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you talking about news reports? Or some sort of official report issued by the morgue or the health ministry?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look at your database, are you able to discern any trends or things might not be reflected in the news media?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've just heard reports about Israeli tanks, armored bulldozers entering the town of Beit Lahiya, in Northern Gaza. Can you explain Israeli reasoning here? How is doing that going to lead, either to the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit, or to the end of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But how does this reintroduction of troops into Gaza, lead, in your view of things, to, say, the release of Corporal Shalit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But when you say a response to that, is this a tactical move that would seize the positions from which the rockets have been fired, or is it a tit-for-a-tat attack against the Palestinians because they've been attacking you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Last week, Israel hit Gaza's only power plant, and a lot of homes, businesses, institutions in Gaza were without power or sewage, and some still are. Why shouldn't one look at that and see it as collective punishment for civilians, as opposed to a narrow tactical move to achieve either the release of Corporate Shalit or to stop rockets from being fired into Israel, out of Gaza?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Even though that might mean depriving a great many people, who have nothing whatever to do with it, with infrastructure and with electricity or sewage?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The father of Corporal Shalit, Norm Shalit today said that he thinks the government of Israel ought to be willing to consider a prisoner swap to win his son's freedom. In the past Israel has traded large numbers of prisoners for Israeli soldiers, and sometimes for the remains of Israeli soldiers. Why not keep the idea of a prisoner swap on the table?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mark Regev, thank you very much for talking with us. MR. REGEV: My pleasure. That is Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Ashton Carter, who teaches national security policy at Harvard's Kennedy School, was assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton administration. He and former defense secretary William Perry recommended in June that the U.S. preemptively strike at and destroy the North Korean Taepodong missile before that test launch. Ashton Carter joins us now from Maine. Ashton Carter, first of all, now that the test has gone ahead, not successfully, are U.S. interests any more threatened today than they were before the test launch of that North Korean missile?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You and William Perry had recommended a preemptive strike, perhaps by a sea-launched cruise missile, before the missile was launched. Had that happened, right now would we be in the middle of a war on the Korean peninsula, that is, North Korea attacking South Korea and some response coming from the south?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If as you say North Korea would not commit suicide, is that the same thing as saying that a logic of mutual deterrence could exist between the United States, South Korea, Japan and North Korea in the way that deterrence held in Europe for several decades?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the main principle expressed by the United States today was that this is not a U.S.-North Korea bilateral crises - it involves the entire region. Is the U.S. right on that score, and wouldn't the action that you had been recommending have been completely unilateral action on the part of the U.S.?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you lighten your own load with this song?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you recall the first time that you heard the blues?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was on the table?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm thinking about that song Suitcase. Don't put too much salt in those black eyed peas. When we listen to your music, what other musical influences do we hear?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do we hear the influence of Mongo Santa Maria in any of your songs on this current CD?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was this song inspired by a particular person?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when you sing the blues, I guess, women are a constant source of inspiration?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did it happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have you heard, if anything, about the condition of your son?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Shalit, the mother of the Israeli soldier who was captured by Hamas in 1994 and who died in the attempt to rescue him has spoken out publicly and she says that the Israeli government should try to negotiate further. What do you think about that? Should the government try further negotiations and scale back the military action?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Shalit, could you tell me a little bit about your son, Corporal Shalit? What kind of soldier is he?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Shalit, what has this last week been like for you and your family?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you heard directly from the Prime Minister?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If he is soliciting your advice, what do you think is the best way to bring your son home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it seems that you're saying that Israel's going about this in the wrong way. To your mind, what should they be doing instead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it possible that from Israel's point of view that this is a diplomatic and military opportunity to strike at Hamas, an opportunity that they want to maximize?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happens if Israel does strike at the heart of Hamas, topple the government, what then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Siegman, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that if this soldier is hurt or killed, Israeli operations will be, and this is his quote, \u201cfar, far worse.\u201d What do you think that might mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it make a difference to the United States who wins this race?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you mean? What kinds of institutional relationships?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the Bush administration has been quiet about this election, not endorsing any candidate over another one. But do you think that this administration would prefer either candidate?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are some of the domestic policies that the Bush administration might be watching for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, are either of these candidates saying things that are more likely to help build that economy?"}

So is beach food the same no matter where you go?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I love crab claws down on the Gulf Coast. MR. EDGE: Yeah. But what about, let's say, up along the Eastern Seaboard, where you're likely to be walking along the boardwalk at the beach? What are you going to find there?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " In Richmond, Virginia, the Church Hill Tunnel has a deadly mystique. It was troubled from the start. Twelve workers lost their lives building the C&O Railway Tunnel, which opened in 1873. It was closed in 1902. Then in 1925, workers started restoring the tunnel to handle additional freight. On October 2 of that year the tunnel collapsed on a work train, killing at least three workers. The tunnel was filled with sand and sealed off. Now some 80 years later there's a plan a dig down and excavate that train. Here to tell us about it is Mark Holmberg. He's a staff writer with the Richmond Times Dispatch. And Mark, do you think it's fair to say you are obsessed with this tunnel?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, you tried to get down there. You sneaked into at least part of the tunnel eight years ago. How far did you get and what did you see there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you see the train itself?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happened back in October of 1925?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did it collapse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the idea now with this plan to go in 80 years after the collapse and try to extract this train?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it must be a tantalizing thing to know that it's there, not that far down, in some kind of shape?"}

The goal is to establish Iraqi security forces inside Ramadi, which has been the base for many insurgents since the fall of Fallujah in 2004. NPR's Jamie Tarabay is on the line from Baghdad to give us the latest. Jamie, U.S. and Iraqi troops established bases overnight around Ramadi. Has the operation begun in earnest? JAMIE TARABAY reporting: Well, the U.S. military is actually trying to play down the importance of this operation, and one of the ground forces commanders is actually saying he has fewer soldiers on the ground than he did, for example, earlier in the month. But having said that, the show of force that they're seeing in Ramadi right now includes long rows of tanks, Marines in boats patrolling the Euphrates River, which is nearby. There are Iraqi sniper teams. Last night, they encircled the southern side of Ramadi and the Iraqi security forces in particular have set up positions outside this perimeter and have said that their aim so far is to be able to block key routes for the insurgents where they come in to receive a lot of their supplies and their reinforcements.

NPR's Rob Gifford joins us on the line from Vienna, where the meeting is taking place. And Rob, I want you to tell us what exactly was announced today, and whether there's anything new in it. ROB GIFFORD reporting: Well, the announcement was actually very short. All of the senior diplomats came out and faced the press, and it was the new British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett who made the statement. It was only about a minute long, and it was not really anything new. Essentially, this was to back up the U.S., to stand together to support the United States and Condoleezza Rice, specifically, who was there in her announcement of yesterday - of this major change in U.S. policy. They didn't go into any of the details of the package of the incentives that they might be offering Iran to come to the table. They didn't go into the incentives. What about disincentives?

On April 19th, something happened at the United States military academy at West Point and, depending upon whose account of what happened, it was either hijinks in uniform or rowdiness unbecoming 1,000 future officers. It all had to do with a fire drill, and a series of room searches. Reporter Greg Bruno has been covering this story for the Times Herald-Record in Middletown, New York, and he joins us from New Windsor, New York. Greg, take us back to the morning of April 19th.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lauretta Hannon lives in Powder Springs, Georgia. Across the Potomac from the Supreme Court, jurors in Alexandria, Virginia spent another day deliberating the fate of Zacarias Moussaoui. Should he be put to death, or sentenced to life in prison? Moussaoui confessed a year ago to six conspiracy counts, claiming that he was planning to fly a plane into the White House. The jury then concluded that, as the prosecution argued, Moussaoui is eligible for the death penalty because his lies to FBI agents resulted in a lack of government action that, had it been taken, would have averted the commission of murder on September 11th. Since then, jurors have heard from several dozen victims and victims' relatives, a minority describing their efforts at reconciliation. The jurors are weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the calculus of the sentencing phase of a trial. Victim impact statements in death penalty cases are an interesting extension of criminal justice. The Supreme Court ruled them out in 1987 and let them back in in 1991. Janice Nadler, a research fellow at the American Bar Foundation in Chicago, has researched this process and written about it. And Professor Nadler, why do we have victim impact statements in a capital case, after the fact of a capital crime has been established?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Reporters describe the jurors in the Moussaoui sentencing phase of the trial being teary eyed as they heard accounts of what happened on 9/11. If there's any crime that any American knows a lot about it would be the killings on 9/11. You didn't have to acquaint people for the first time that many people died that day. Is there anything to that beyond simply the emotional manipulation of the jurors?"}

The Senate is preparing to take up the immigration debate next week. Today's protest followed similar rallies yesterday in Phoenix and other cities, including Atlanta, where immigrants also staged a one day work and spending strike. As immigration rights activists took to the streets, President Bush took to the airwaves. In his Saturday radio address, the President said his administration is tightening border security, but he called again for a guest worker program. President GEORGE W.

The U.S. military had gotten a tip that an al-Qaida member was in that house. A report issued by Iraqi police says U.S. forces gathered 11 family members into a room and executed all of them, including four women and five children, one of them a six-month-old baby. A U.S. military spokesman says it is highly unlikely that these accusations are true. Matthew Schofield obtained the Iraqi police document about the attack.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was she excited to hear about the money? Did she need it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it sounds like you guys weren't even tempted to pocket any of it, huh?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you at all concerned, should he return to Liberia, what that would mean for your country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I get the sense that you have quite a lot in front of you. After two decades of turmoil in your country, you have incredible problems; widespread poverty, government corruption, no electricity, not even running water in your capital city. You said that you're only going to be in office for one six-year term. That seems like a lot to accomplish in such a short time. Where do you begin?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you specifically need to do first for all of these other changes to fall into place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You addressed a joint session of Congress this week, and you're scheduled to meet with President Bush on Tuesday. If you could choose only one thing for the United States to do to help Liberia, what would that be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You seem to have a very ambitious agenda, but yet such a short time. Are you ever, I don't know, overwhelmed with what's in front of you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So your book has quite the subtitle: A Thoroughly Obsessive, Intermittently Uplifting and Occasionally Unbiased Account of the Duke-North Carolina Basketball Rivalry. You felt the need to qualify things for us a bit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Right. So where did this beast come from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " They made her stay in the same spot for every game?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So why do you think it is that we need these rivalries? What does it do for us as people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, with the Americans out of the picture in the WBC, what happens now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Stefan, what happened to the U.S.?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, that Cuban team roared up and surprised a lot of baseball fans. Is that because we've just never seen Cuba's best players compete against Major Leaguers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Cuba's manager, who has a lot to crow about right now, said the tournament should be held every other year, and that Cuba wants to host the games next time around. Does that idea have any traction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Stefan, before we move on, let's talk about the tournament. How did this maiden voyage go?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, before we say goodbye, you're talking to us from Greensboro, North Carolina. Who have you been watching down there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Stefan Fatsis covers sports and the business of sports for the Wall Street Journal. When President Bush first introduced the doctrine of preemptive war, we asked a number of people about the moral, legal and military justification for attacking a country without provocation. Father Richard John Neuhaus was one of the people we spoke to. He's the president of the Institute on Religion and Public Life, and he's editor-in-chief of the monthly journal called First Things. When we last spoke to him, he thought the president had made a strong case for attacking Iraq. Father Richard John Neuhaus joins us again today. And, Father, the president today reaffirmed his doctrine of preemptive war. Are you still steadfast in your support of this policy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are many who believe that the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq undermines this doctrine of preemptive war. How has the failure to find any evidence of those weapons changed your thinking about this doctrine, this policy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I have to interrupt you here, because I guess the question is, are they standing at your threshold or are they sitting in their own house thinking about the possibility of breaking into your abode?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if we can extend that, then, based on the set of facts that we know to be true right now, does that justify going to his home and attacking him in his domicile?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Were you surprised that the president today, in issuing his new national security strategy, made this vigorous defense, actually reaffirmed his doctrine for preemptive war? Was that surprising to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, I want to put to you the same question that I put to Father Richard John Neuhaus. Were you surprised that the president gave this full throttle defense of this doctrine given his early rationale for war and the facts on the ground today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you said the ball got rolling, what happened next?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Twenty-five incidents? So were they able to track him through his credit card or through some kind of video surveillance in the store?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And we should note something, Michael. Apparently Claude Allen has a twin brother?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And five thousand dollars? Is that correct, the total amount of money involved in this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where will we see his imprint in the Bush Administration in terms of policy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From Medicare Plan B to Social Security, to faith-based initiatives, would he be involved in all of these things?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, can you just tell us a little bit about this firm, Custer Battles, and what they were doing in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what came out in the trial as far as the kind of business that they were contracted to do and what they ended up doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what did they do that was fraudulent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, how did Custer Battles explain these actions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, this was the first case of war profiteering in Iraq to go to trial. Do you think there will be others?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Mr. Wagner, I assume there are other fish there in Nebraska, what's so special about catfish?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, having grown up in the South, I'm pretty familiar with catfish, the kind that you catch out of rivers or that are raised in ponds here. Is there anything different about the Nebraska catfish than the one I might catch, say, in Mississippi?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So take me fishing. What are we gonna use today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Chicken livers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So when did you first start fishing, do you remember your first catfish?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a special Nebraska way to prepare catfish?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a local establishment there in Omaha that's known for its catfish?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can I have hushpuppies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So I understand you're planning on heading out to do some fishing this weekend. Where are you going?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have you heard from either the players, the major leaguers who are on the U.S. team? You've got Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Johnny Damon. What have they been saying about how they're doing here and the fact that they could be out of this thing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if the U.S. were not to advance, what does that mean for the World Baseball Classic?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So these were ships with a short shelf life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was it like for you the first time you stepped inside one of these caves?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, are these findings, without a doubt, the world's oldest seafaring ships, or at least the makings of the world's oldest ships?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, what's in these documents, 5,000 pages?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You can actually see who they're talking about. Now, we should say this is not actually a complete picture. The documents only provide information about half of the detainees, and classified evidence is excluded as well. But based on what you've seen, what do we now know about this very secretive prison?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you give us an example of one case where the association seems to be strong and one where it would perhaps appear to be more tenuous?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've been trying to get your hands on this information for some time. Now that these documents have been released through this Freedom of Information request, what's the most important information that you see in these papers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell us what the scene was earlier today in Pakistan when President Musharraf was meeting with President Bush?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This meeting comes at a time when President Musharraf has been facing growing opposition in Pakistan. Even his Islamic base has been calling for him to step down. Was the purpose of President Bush's visit just to show solidarity?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is a military regime that we're talking about and President Bush has stated over and over again that his mission is to spread democracy in the Muslim world. Did he address that issue at all during his visit to Pakistan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Bush is not exactly popular among the Pakistani people. What did Musharaff have to gain from appearing with President Bush in this meeting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is Musharraf's government stable?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Mr. Stutz, what was it that set you off on this quest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tons per year, you mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what do we know about why that is? Is the reduced snow pack part of a global warming trend? Or is it caused by something else, maybe drought?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, will you read for us from your book?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So in this letter, Sinclair describes a meeting with Fred Moore, who was Sacco and Vanzetti's lawyer at the time. They're meeting at a hotel in Denver. And he writes, quote, \"Alone in a hotel room with Fred, I begged him to tell me the full truth. He then told me that the men were guilty and he told me in every detail how he had framed a set of alibis for them.\" So what does this tell us about what Sinclair knew about this case that was different from what he wrote in his book?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think was going on, culturally, that made him slow to acknowledge these things?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you think people read his novels? Did they look at this as a fictional account of something or did they expect him to be giving a true account of what happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did investigators learn about what was allegedly going on here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well what happens in Appalachia? You have a mayor and thirteen other people there under indictment. Does he stay mayor while this is all being prosecuted?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are people saying about that in Appalachia?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it the kind of thing where supporters of the mayor would say he's been set up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That this is par for the course?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well what happens now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk first about this letter from Truman Capote. It's now been made public. It was, as I understand it, given to a museum from a cousin of Mr. Capote. What does it say and how does it help quash this rumor?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And by saying that he's seen it would appear to put some distance at least with it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did this rumor get started in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah, that that would fuel it. In other words, she was one and done, and if she were such a great writer, why wouldn't she keep writing great books?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you look closely at TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and the writing of Truman Capote, do you see anyway that Truman Capote could have written TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wayne Flynt, have you met Harper Lee yourself?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you've talked to her about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell us anything that she might have told you, without violating the confidence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you really think this letter from Truman Capote alluding to a book from Harper Lee that he has seen and that he thinks is quite good, do you think that will actually kill the rumor that he actually wrote the book?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The people who are in those FEMA trailers are supposed to be in them for 18 months. Do you think that's a realistic timeframe, and where would they go after that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you have a storm of this magnitude, wiping out so much of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, you end up with basically a clean slate for redeveloping that coast. What's the vision for the state?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are people, of course, though, who would say, you know, bigger is not necessarily better. What's to keep big interests, big developers, maybe hotels or casinos from building in places where maybe just single-family homes were before, people who don't have the money to rebuild on the coast?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do you figure that you'll end up with communities, as is predicted for New Orleans, that will be substantially smaller, shrunken?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Mississippi governor Haley Barbour, a Republican, talking with us from Jackson. The Capitol of Louisiana is Baton Rouge. It's also home to Louisiana State University, to the historically black Southern University and since September it's been home to a lot of people displaced by Katrina. At one time there were as many as 250,000 people joining the half million or so who live in and around the city. I asked Stephen Moret, the head of the Baton Rouge Area Chamber of Commerce, how many of those people are still there and expect to stay?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to take you back to some of the things we were hearing six months ago and what has stuck and what turns out to have been just a brief spike. We were hearing about New Orleans businesses, law firms, other sorts of service industries of that sort, buying homes, almost by the subdivision around Baton Rouge to move their people upstate. Has it happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are any of those firms staying in your city or are they going back home to New Orleans?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's happened at the airport? How many flights are coming in or out now as opposed to six months ago?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Stephen Moret, how is President and Chief Executive Officer of the Baton Rouge Area Chamber of Commerce. He spoke to us from Baton Rouge. We have the good fortune to talk to you on Ash Wednesday. Was it hard to write this one, given the state of the city right now? Archbishop ALFRED C. HUGHES (New Orleans): Not really. Because, you know, ashes are a symbol of our mortality, and Katrina brought home to us our mortality. Up until now, we've been focused a great deal on the physical recovery, humanitarian needs, basic pastoral needs. This is a time now for us to look at the moral and spiritual dimensions of what God is asking of us. Father, I've been here for a week now, and I've talked to many people who say that they're leaning on things, that they have crutches in their life that weren't there before. Sometimes it's alcohol, sometimes it's cigarettes, sometimes it's food. Does that worry you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you see evidence of that here, that people are coping in ways that aren't quite healthy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So many of your parishioners are trying to make sense of this. How do you advise them when they, you know, they look skyward and they ask God, Why? How could you do this to us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In India, there's both anticipation and trepidation that the U.S. and India will sign a nuclear cooperation deal. India would have to agree to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities and open some to inspection. In exchange, India would be able to buy civilian nuclear technology from the U.S. But it's far from a done deal. For some insight into the debate in India, we're joined by M.J. Akbar. He's editor-in-chief of the English-language daily The Asian Age in New Delhi. But right now, he's a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution here in Washington. And he's with us in our studio. Thanks for coming in. Mr. M.J. AKBAR (Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution): Thanks. A former Indian ambassador to the U.S. has talked about both parties wrangling over the terms of nuclear endearment. Why are these terms becoming so hard to reach?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me ask you for a bit of a balance sheet here. For people in India who think this is a good thing, we should make this deal and it is to our advantage to do so, what are the pluses for India?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And opponents in India, I imagine, would say, look, we've created this nuclear program pretty much from scratch on our own, why do we need somebody else to come in and put limitations on what we've achieved?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Roll back from the nuclear capabilities that it already has?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your country has now had visitors from two consecutive U.S. presidents: Bill Clinton in 2000, now George Bush. What does that say, do you think, about India's standing in the world and how it's changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One thing that George Bush will not be doing, which Bill Clinton did do in his visit back in 2000, is address the Indian Parliament. Why not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there really a deal here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, are the two sides caught up on ideological issues or are the biggest stumbling blocks to a signed deal more practical matters, like say how to get uranium out and then back into Iran?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, the International Atomic Energy Agency will be meeting again on March 6th. That's one week from tomorrow. What would be enough, short of a signed deal, to impress the international community that progress is being made?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did that come to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, for weeks, now, secrets societies have thrown fancy balls, kings and queens have been coronated in their full regalia, and the cruise maskers have been parading through downtown Mobile on these elaborate floats. But this afternoon, there was a different kind of parade there. Can you tell me about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, you don't have to pay any dues to some fancy society to come parade?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So tell me a little bit more about Joe Cain, who was this fellow?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And he was disappointed, right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell me a little bit about the Joe Cain procession that happens on the Sunday before Fat Tuesday there in Mobile. The people who start the parade are all dressed in black?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I remember coming to Joe Cain Sunday, and everybody spreads out their picnic blanket there in Bienville Square, there in downtown Mobile. And one of the floats that goes by is someone dressed up like an Indian Chief?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But to this day, somebody dresses up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We heard there in Jamie Tarabay's report that the Golden Mosque holds the remains of two imams. Can you explain their significance to Shiite Muslims?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So if you're a Shiite Muslim, then, how would you see this particular shrine? How significant would it be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would Sunnis view a shrine like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so if you think about the reverberations within the Shiite community to have an attack on a shrine that is considered so holy, where does that take you? What does this mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Sasha didn't show up. Did the American ice hockey team show up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, are you at all concerned about which country the company is based in that buys P and O that operates U.S. ports?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I'd like to hear what some of the other dimensions are that you're concerned with, but first, the issue of ownership. Is it inappropriate for any foreign owner, bear in mind it was a British owner until recently, to be operating ports? When you were with the Coast Guard, did you interact with that company? Did it make any difference who the owner of that company was?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But before we even address the question of who the foreign country is, when a foreign-owned company has a lease to operate a port, do you see many nationals from that ownership country around the port, or are they simply the employers of the Americans who are working in Seattle, Tacoma or Long Beach or wherever?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If the ownership of the company that's operating the port is not tops on your list of security concerns about shipping, what is top of your list?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I just wanted to ask you one question. This is perhaps stretching an analogy, an historical analogy, that one might invoke in this case. When the Israeli commandos struck at Entebbe Airport back in Uganda years ago to rescue a planeload of hostages, the way they knew their way around was that an Israeli company had built that terminal. They had all the blueprints. They knew the way the airport worked. It seemed to be a great advantage to them. That's the way historians and journalists have written about it. Is that a concern? Should we be concerned about how much access there is to details of buildings at critical places in the United States?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Lt. Cogglin, how do you remember Don Herbert?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have your male colleagues had to say about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Dr. Nathanson, let's say you're a patient, and the doctor walks in the room and he's got a tie on, what do you do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, should patients tell their physicians to get rid of the tie if they've got one on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it possible to create a necktie that would have some sort of Scotch guard or decontaminant within the tie?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Dr. Vivienne Nathanson, at the British Medical Association. But there is a line between the understated and the unprofessional. According to that study at Christ Church School of Medicine and Health Sciences, while patients like an opened collar, they weren't too keen on other less traditional looks such as dyed hair or facial piercings. In the Philippines mass burials have begun for the estimated eighteen hundred victims of Friday's mudslides. The river of mud buried an entire farming village in the Southern Leyte province. Only twenty survivors were pulled from the mud on Friday. None since then. The U.S. military has arrived to help with the relief operations. Carlos Conde has been reporting on this for the New York Times. He was at the scene of the disaster today. We reached him on his cell phone in this remote area of the Philippines. What's left of the village of Guinsaugon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So Mr. Rashid, are these protests really about the cartoons?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How is that happening? Is there an organized effort for this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I have a question about the riots. The targets of the violence aren't necessarily Western embassies or Danish missions. Why is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think these protests are somehow a watershed in relations between the Muslim world and the West?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just ahead, the rough and tumble of Louisiana politics. And joining us now to talk about last night's legislative session is long-time Louisiana political analyst Elliott Stonecipher. I asked him how Louisiana lawmakers could have completed a two-week legislative session focusing specifically on storm recovery without agreeing on a mechanism to distribute money to storm victims?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did racial division show up in the legislative session?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what happened with that? Will the displaced voters be able to cast a ballot in the New Orleans elections?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What got you fascinated in the banjo in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When did you learn about the history of this instrument? When did you find out that this is something that had come from Africa with slaves?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " No, not at all. But this would be what a woman like this would be playing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, at the same time that this was going on in white culture in urban areas, what was happening in black culture with the banjo?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it would have been something negative, playing a banjo for an African American at that point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " To see pictures and hear how the banjo made its way to bluegrass, go to our web site at npr.org. That's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. From NPR News, I'm Debbie Elliott. The Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas is expected to name Ismail Haniyeh as its Prime Minister. Hamas won an outright majority in the Palestinian legislative elections. Mahmoud Abbas of the nationalist Fatah movement remains the president, but it's now up to Hamas to name ministers, who would actually run the government. Mr. Haniyeh is often described as a pragmatist or a moderate, at least by Hamas standards. For what that means and for other questions about Hamas' victory, we turn to Rob Malley, who is director of the International Crisis Group's Middle East Program. Robert Malley writes about Hamas in the current issue of The New York Review of Books. And, Robert Malley, when they say that, say, Ismail Haniyeh or somebody else is a pragmatic leader of Hamas, what do they mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " According to Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, President Abbas may ask the next Palestinian Prime Minister to affirm existing peace agreements like the road map, things that Hamas does not acknowledge. Do you think he's capable of doing that, or does that exceed the limits of pragmatism for someone in Hamas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm. Ismail Haniyeh, who may or conceivably still may not be named Prime Minister of the Palestinian authority, grew up in Gaza. This is not somebody coming in from Tunisia, the way the Arafat leadership did. On the other hand, trained as an imam and in Arabic literature, not exactly a technocrat. Is he up to the job?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When the Palestinian National Authority was first established, the leadership of Fatah came to Gaza and also ultimately, too, to the West Bank, from overseas. In this case, the leadership of Hamas remains in Damascus. It's outside the country. Is there going to be a tension between the leadership that's been exiled and the leadership that's in the parliament?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Julie Zickefoose is a contributing editor for Birdwatchers Digest. How different is searching the web in China from searching it here? Well, we've asked our man in Beijing, Anthony Kuhn, to join me in a little exercise. We both have our computers handy, and we're going to search some of the same terms on different sides of what they sometimes call the great firewall of China. You with me, Anthony?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I have today's news, Falun Gong protest exclusion from parade, in the Miami Herald. That's from February 12, actually. And then Falun Dafa, that's the falundafa.org web site, Falun Dafa and Falun Gong information center. How about you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which is in Chinese. So I guess I can search this either with Chinese characters if I knew how to do that or in English?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, what if you had entered Falun Gong in Chinese in the Google.cn search engine?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now let's not be partial to Google here, let's try Yahoo.com. I'll search Falun Gong on Yahoo.com and I'll see what I get here. Well I get a news results again for Falun Gong, Falun Gong Protestors Exclusion from Parade, and then there's the Wikipedia entry also, and Falan Dafa's own website. So it's very similar to what I saw on Google.com. And, do you see the same stuff?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You don't even get the appearance of some information being turned up by the search?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, without going into much detail, I assume that people who are very clever with computers can figure some way around this in China?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you get the feeling that it's just foreigners like yourself who are trying to use the internet who feel thwarted in this? Or do the Chinese talk about it? Have you ever heard Chinese civilians remark on what they can't find on the internet?"}

The judge had ejected him from the penalty phase of his trial yesterday because of his frequent outbursts. Today defense lawyers and federal prosecutors began direct questioning of potential jurors. A group of them will decide if Moussaoui will be executed or spend the rest of his life in prison. NPR's Larry Abramson is in Alexandria, Virginia. He joins us from outside the Federal Courthouse. Larry, did the judge give any explanation for allowing Moussaoui to return to the courtroom?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So he promised to behave himself? What was his demeanor actually like during the jury selection process?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " NPR's Larry Abramson, speaking to us outside the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia. It has become a daily routine in the news business this month, checking on the day's events related to the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Today, high level EU-Islamic talks in Saudi Arabia, protests in Pakistan, Hamas organizes 500 Palestinian children in stomping on the Danish flag, Iran says it didn't fan protests and demands an apology. This conflict simply does not go away. Perhaps that's because it reflects some very hard and unpleasant truths about the relationship between Muslims and the West in the 21st century. Christopher Caldwell of the Weekly Standard has been writing about that relationship and joins us. Chris Caldwell, what do you think is the biggest single lesson the West should take away from this episode of the Muhammad cartoons so far?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it seem possible to you that in the reaction to Muslim immigration, or to events like the French riots and the Danish cartoons, that Europe might actually turn increasingly to xenophobic movements, which have typically been, if not marginalized, certainly held at bay in recent years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So in the 90s, you saw different explanations. Yes, there were some that were racially motivated but there were some that had different motives. Do you think that that history is the reason that when churches are burned in the South like this it gets so much national attention?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think environmental research is especially subject to this kind of pressure?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand the draw of these beautiful beaches. I myself have a home off the Panhandle Coast. But if you look at the Gulf of Mexico as whole, you have oil and gas development off the coast of Alabama, off the coast of Texas, off the coast of Louisiana. You yourself have supported drilling in the Arctic for oil. How do sort of say Florida deserves special protection when there is, according to President Bush, this national priority of decreasing our dependence on foreign oil?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think the pressure is such, though, at this stage in the country's conversation about energy, you know, something like 60 percent of this nation's energy comes from foreign sources. And it seems to be what you hear people talking about. Gas prices are going up and up and up. Do you think Florida can continue to say we're different, step back?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, think about that though in a state like Florida, where there isn't a huge amount of public transportation. People in Florida drive. How do you start to talk about conservation when so many people are in their cars going places?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's one more area I'd like to ask you about. You're a Cuban-American and you support the U.S. policy of the embargo on Cuba. But at the same time, U.S. energy companies are saying Cuba is the place we need to go to start looking for oil and gas. Would that not solve some of the pressures on Florida?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Good. I understand that Turin is the place where chocolate and hazelnut first met?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, there's another specialty of Turin that involves chocolate. It's a drink called betereen(ph)?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now can you find this anywhere else?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Andrew, did the newspaper or the editor, Flemming Rose, advise the cartoonists about this prohibition against depicting the Prophet Muhammad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He didn't know about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The cartoons were first published in September of 2005. What was the original reaction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, that was back in the fall. How did the reaction to the cartoon shift from a protest against the newspaper to a protest against the entire country and its companies and its exports?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well there's some question about those cartoons, because along the way, protesters circulated a dossier that included the original cartoons as well as other pictures. Was there an effort to mislead the public about what had been originally published in order to stir up protest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, why is this city looking to this fast food tax to solve this problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would that work? The stings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Wouldn't they also then be passing on the tax to those young people? Isn't this, in some ways, just an indirect tax on the customers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what if I talk to you one year from now, and we find that even with this tax you still have a litter problem? You still find sandwich wrappers and paper cups all over town, even with the stepped-up crews, even with the sting operations. What do you do next?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can you tell us about Coach Vaught's style?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you remember most about Coach Vaught's career at Ole Miss?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm wondering if these ads are appealing to just a certain demographic?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there really a market for that, people who want to see these ads in their own free time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it's understandable that soldiers deployed in war zones, with much on their minds, might not be able to think about brushing their teeth regularly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would it work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When we think of various forms of dentifrice that are out in the market, a tremendous effort goes into just flavor, and to, to how pleasant it will be to use them. How do you work that out as you approach your problem like this where you're talking about in effect battlefield dental hygiene uh, how important is it for something to taste reasonably good?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the plaque is there, it's just more spread out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it doesn't show up on an angiogram that way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the implications for women who may being having symptoms, an angiogram shows that they seem to be fine - what do you tell the women and their doctors about what tests should be done?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do women typically present with different symptoms of experiencing a heart attack than men do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And would this difference in how the arteries build up plaque, would that account for why women may experience different symptoms?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " After her husband died, she became very protective of his legacy. How did she go about protecting that, and what the family stood for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Coretta Scott King was able to get the King Center founded. She worked long and hard for passage of the Martin Luther King holiday. What work did she think still needed to be done?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did she talk to you about James Earl Ray? She and the family had expressed doubts that he acted alone, and, in fact, she had made moves to get him exonerated. Did she talk to you about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Young, what will you most remember Coretta Scott King for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Andrew Young the former congressman. He was also ambassador to the United Nations, and mayor of Atlanta. Remembering Coretta Scott King. Peter Coy is economics editor for BusinessWeek. He's in New York. Peter Coy, unprecedented profits for Exxon Mobil. Are oil company executives unprecedentedly confident about their future?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you really mean that it's the atmosphere of the markets nowadays that if you're -- if the company brings in a profit or whatever, it's $36 billion in one year, the answer is what have you done for me lately? What are you going to do in 2006?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One last question. What do these profits portend for relations between Exxon Mobil or other oil companies and the countries in which they do their drilling?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell us more about what you're seeing up there. Well, I was worried for a few days that you were going to think I was a complete fraud because it's been warm and puddley, but today we're back in the dominion of winter. Everything's hard and crunchy, and there's wind that makes it feel like minus 20 degrees centigrade. But despite that, I've been hearing great horned owls dueting to one another. Now this isn't just something that they do all winter long. They're amongst the earliest birds to breed. They'll be on their nest in March, and this probably was a matted pair talking to one another, whoo-whooing at one another from different parts of their territory, starting to get in the mood. So it proves if, you know, even though we're still freezing to death here in the snow zone, spring actually is on its way. Now how, exactly, do birds and animals know that spring is coming?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about other animals? How do they know the season is changing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When Hamas espouses a theocratic state to be established in Palestine, what does that mean? Do you get a sense of what they would be looking at?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if they try to impose that program, what do you think the result will be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so are you arguing that the people in Palestine might actually see better government from Hamas, that if the Muslim Brotherhood were to enter the government in large numbers in Egypt, that the people there would see better governance?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in building a democracy, sending people to the polls is only one step in that process. What else do you need to see to say that we've really achieved something here, that you see true democratic governance for the people, by the people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you say women's right to know laws, what do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The justices, in a number of rulings, have stressed the notion of undue burden on the woman and whether restrictions that are passed at the state level have imposed too high a burden. Are you rethinking how you're shaping legislation to address those concerns that the court has brought?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The same polls that you refer to where a majority of Americans show a support for Roe v. Wade also show support for a number of restrictions, things like spousal notification, parental notification and I think also show a great deal of opposition to certain late term abortions that the opponents call partial birth abortions. What do you do about those public attitudes and the laws that seem to emanate from them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Marion Winik lives in Glen Rock, Pennsylvania. So while Ford is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, that does not mean all those workers will automatically head to the unemployment office. Ford's contract with the United Auto Workers includes certain job security measures that protect employees even when they're laid off. For an explanation, we turn to Micheline Maynard. She's the Detroit bureau chief for The New York Times and she joins us now. So, Micheline, what does it mean to be fired or laid off under the UAW contract?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, and does that apply to all of the employees in these plants?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much do these employees earn?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what do these workers do with that time? Do they recalibrate their job prospects?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Governor is proposing legislation aimed at making coal mines safer. Can you tell us what he'd like to see enacted?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now even if some of these practices are changed and some of these measures are enacted, isn't enforcement a big part of what you're talking about here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How strongly are mines regulated today and how often are they checked for compliance with safety rules?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you learn from these accidents about responding?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How long have you been covering this story?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you describe for us how officials say this group was operating?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " More and more information is now coming out about those who were arrested. What can you tell us about these people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did authorities give any information as to how they believe this group came together?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did the investigation take so long?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now since these arrests, ALF has struck again claiming responsibility for another arson, a mansion in Puget Sound. What does that tell us about the group and how it works and where these 11 alleged conspirators fit into the operation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Debbie Elliott. This week, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the terrain of history shifting beneath our feet. And she said the nation's diplomatic corps must shift with it. Secretary Rice outlined her plan to reposition diplomatic forces around the world. Now, if they want to advance through the ranks, Foreign Service officers will have to serve in so-called \u201chardship posts\u201d in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan. To talk about these changes, we're joined on the line by J. Anthony Holmes. Ambassador Holmes heads the American Foreign Services Association, which represents active and retired members of the Foreign Service. Ambassador Holmes, welcome. Mr. J. ANTHONY Mr. HOLMES (Ambassador, Foreign Service Association): Thank you, very much. Nice to be here. These changes are part of the administration's goal of transformational diplomacy. How do diplomats understand this new construct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, one of the things that Secretary Rice said, as she was trying to illustrate her point, is that there are nearly 200 cities with over a million people, yet they have no formal U.S. diplomatic presence. How big of a personnel shift is this going to be if we see Foreign Service officers now deployed to these cities that are outside of capitols?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the specific safety concerns when you talk about being removed in different places like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you look a quarter-century down the road, say, how do you think this new structure will have altered the overall culture of the Foreign Service?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This week marked the 25th anniversary of the end of Iranian hostage crisis. After 444 days of captivity, 52 American hostages were freed on January 20th 1981. One of them is retired U.S. Army Colonel Chuck Scott. He joins us from his home in Jonesboro, Georgia. Hello, sir. Mr. CHUCK Mr. SCOTT (Colonel, Retired, U.S. Army): Hi, Debbie. It's nice to be with you. What were you doing at the U.S. Embassy back in 1979 when the Iranian students seized the building?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you remember about that day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, you and the other hostages were held for 444 days, I'm sure that people ask you often what was it like? What do you tell them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you do that? How do you mentally prepare yourself to live that way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I wonder if you could paint a picture for us of that day 25 years ago when you and the other hostages were released? What was it like returning home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " EPERB is the rescue beacon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, when, when did you realize that someone did know where you were and that you were going to be rescued?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you're still on that boat now I take it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well despite everything that's happened to you, would you do this race again?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now do you believe that the NSA actually listened to some of your phone calls or monitored your e-mails?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But I just want to clarify something. The plaintiffs in the ACLU suit include individuals or organizations that make frequent overseas phone calls, send e-mail overseas. Do these groups or these organizations believe that they were singled out in this domestic spying program, or is this lawsuit intended to make a larger point?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It seems like there's a suspicion or a belief that the government may have been doing this, but no hard evidence. How do you build a case on a belief or a suspicion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But that's not--it's two very different readings of the statute. The White House believes that the president does have the authority. Do you face a bit of an uphill battle there in trying to pull the federal courts into this in trying to determine the boundaries or the limits on presidential authority?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Filing a lawsuit against the federal government is no small thing. Why did you decide to sign on to this lawsuit, and what sort of calculus did you have to go through to make that decision?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now how had you started classes when Katrina hit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Uh-huh. So you're trying to sort of just pick up where you left off?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you walked around the campus there, I'm assuming that there are lots of signs of what happened. Can you tell me what it looks like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who's living in the FEMA trailers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Uh-huh, not the students?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So has there been a little dislocation then of the student population, too?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell me about your first moment walking into class today. Did it feel momentous in some way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was the prayer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Regina, what did you do in the months that you couldn't go back to Xavier after Katrina hit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it seem to you that you're now part of a pretty dramatically changed institution, smaller and different from what it was?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Regina, what are your plans after you graduate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And they were picked up the end of last summer?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of overtures did you make to the military, and what was the response?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have any ideas about what prompted their release?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " After all your research, what are your thoughts about what Samuel Alito was doing with this organization, which has been, of course, a big question in Washington?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In 20 years when we have the next Princeton-educated Supreme Court nominee, what will be written about that person? Is there any kind of equivalent today where there's maybe a sense of privilege?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So, Chan Sethi, has covering this story made you want to continue in journalism?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We know now that this dance has been going on for a while between the West and Iran over its nuclear capability. Do you think that President Ahmadinejad's remarks have indeed indicated a new readiness to abandon negotiations altogether?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are fears that Iran, which is the second-largest oil-producing country in the world, will respond to this international pressure by holding back some of its oil which is called playing the oil card. Was there any hint or mention of that in the news conference?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This trauma as we mention has really been growing. I'm wondering how ordinary Iranians are feeling about what's going on. The economy is quite dependent on Europe. There's been talk of possible sanctions. Are people supporting the president's defiance or feeling that he's taking them into unnecessarily dangerous waters?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Iran has willfully violated its agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency. What do you make of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the signs that Iran is developing nuclear weapons and not just peaceful energy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Even with satellite photos, one still has to guess at human intentions, but what's your best guess of what Iran is doing and will do over the next few weeks and months?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We just heard President Bush say that he's not going to prejudge what the United Nations Security Council should do. Do you think it'll be difficult to get sanctions passed at the Security Council?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can the United States take a leadership position here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So did they kill you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...that would illustrate that or a tale you have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You did hit upon strategies that at least one nasty administrator called pedagogical paydirt. I mean, you did work to connect with him. Will you tell us how?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...who you never thought you'd ever hear from again?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did the kids give you that you carry away with you? What sort of confidence, what kind of maturity?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How common are state bills that mandate health coverage or more spending on health coverage by employers, employers generally or by Wal-Mart specifically?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, are people then watching the Maryland law assuming it's going to be challenged, watching to see whether it's going to be thrown out as a violation of ERISA?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what have you heard and what do you plan to do now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now help us piece together this puzzle. What will you learn from the flood plans from FEMA that would contribute to your planning here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are other people from New Orleans East in Atlanta. There are other people in Arkansas and Mississippi, all over--Baton Rouge, for sure. Are you able to keep in touch at all with one another?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of damage did you have in your house?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Some of the questions surrounding the rebuilding of New Orleans are about, well, what I'd call social infrastructure. Are there going to be schools? Is there going to be a working hospital? Are there going to be commercial services? Are there going to be, you know, institutions of community around you if you go back?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you'll do this until January 23rd? Is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much is this costing the state?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many people in North Dakota qualify for this program?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so North Dakota will pick up the bill for Medicaid patients who are mistakenly denied coverage. What about Medicare patients who've enrolled in the new system, show up at the pharmacy and discover that their name is left off the role?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As the state was gearing up for this transition, did you warn the federal government that this might be a problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Governor, you're a Republican. Some of the governors who've also taken emergency action are Democrats, and in some cases, they view this as an opportunity to point out problems that the current administration, Republican administration, is having in administering this program. Since you are a Republican, does this put you at all in an uncomfortable position to take this action?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's was North Dakota governor, John Hoeven. He was speaking to us from his office in Bismarck, North Dakota. Police in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Illinois, got tired of motorists treating stop signs as merely an invitation to slow down, so they came up with a new idea. It's essentially the equivalent of an exclamation point. Beneath regular stop signs at key intersections in Park Ridge, you'll now find a second red octagon with the following warning: `Stop means stop.' Park Ridge police Commander Lou Jogmen says the new signs are working, and he joins us now to explain. First, Commander Jogmen, how did you get the idea to do this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And he thought this would work better than, say, placing an officer at a sign to issue citations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And basically what was the problem, people just were ignoring signs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now in the Chicago Sun Times, one of the local newspapers out there, you've already declared the signs a success. What's the evidence of that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Coming to a full stop?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think they work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any derision? Anyone have second thoughts about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Park Ridge, Illinois, is outside Chicago. You're out there near O'Hare Airport. How much traffic do you see in a suburb like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So right now the signs that are enhanced carry this additional phrase `Stop means stop.' Are you going to change that over time?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do you do that by meeting with them? By courting them? How do you get your phone calls answered?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now in the case of full disclosure, I should say that my husband is an attorney and a registered lobbyist. So I know a little bit about this. I certainly hear about it at home. Help us understand the culture of lobbying in Washington. It's a city where at 6:30 on any given evening the restaurants and the bars and the hotels are often filled with people clinking glasses at something called a fund-raiser. How do these things work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The current lobbying scandal that's making headlines involves a group of individuals and a specific firm, but this has cast a shadow over the entire industry. How much does this concern you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Any heartburn in the short run?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, Mr. Berman, for those who believe that lobbying in general has a certain odor to it, how do you defend what you do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is the signing statement a way for the president to sidestep the intentions of Congress--for example, when it passed the torture ban?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does it mean that they don't have to abide by those pieces of the bill? I mean, how does that fit into the system of checks and balances?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So does this have the force of law? You know, who's to determine who's right, Congress or the president?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now again and again in this presidential statement that I'm looking at that comes from the White House, you see the words `president's constitutional authority as commander in chief.' What does that mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what is the political impact of these statements?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where did this signing statement come from? Who was the first president to use it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what was Samuel Alito's role in this in the Reagan administration?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How frequently have other presidents used the signing statement compared with, say, President Bush?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could this be an important issue when you look at, say, the history of the presidency and the future of the presidency in this country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So who was Little Jack Horner?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So was this common? Is there historical evidence to support the theory that bribes were often delivered in pies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So could the US be, in effect, training forces that will eventually become sectarian militias?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, one of the other things General Vine's talked a good bit about was the need for better infrastructure, that right now the defense and interior ministries just aren't able to provide even basics like water and ammunition. Why is that such a problem?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What can happen when you do have these trained officers ready to fight or ready to protect their country but without the stable government support behind them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There have been some complaints from Iraq's Ministry of Defense that they're not getting the appropriate military equipment that they need from the US. For example, instead of tanks, they're getting pickup trucks. Is there some reluctance to build too strong of an Iraqi force that eventually will not be under US control anymore?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell us what happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was everything lost?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have any idea what caused the fire?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, you've been in that community for a long time now. Bayou La Batre is a little--call it a fishing village. The seafood industry is prominent there. It's a very small town. How have your patients reacted to this news?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your clinic was first damaged by Hurricane Georges back in 1998. You got it back together. Then Hurricane Katrina washed through it and now this. How do you cope with all that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is NPR News. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Debbie Elliott. Take a piece of dirt, coat it in a little flour and egg, deep-fry it. I bet you it tastes pretty darn good. John T. Edge is our curator of all things culinary and he wants to talk today about post-modern fried food. Hi, John T. Mr. JOHN T. EDGE (Southern Foodways Alliance): Hi, Debbie. Great to be with you. Luckily, dirt is not among the things on your list, but some pretty weird things are. Oreos? People fry Oreos?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " They have Twinkies in Scotland?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " John T., what is the weirdest thing that you've ever seen fried?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Inside of the meat?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " They sealed it up so that the fires wouldn't spread?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was going on in the community while all this was taking place, days of attempted rescues and these fires raging underground? Did everyone come together?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You could see the smoke?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you think an experience like this, such a huge trauma in a small town, how does it mark the town even this long after the fact?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned the memorial that's held every year. Do you feel the impact of what happened back in 1968 throughout the year? Are there other times when it comes back to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mining is something that people do in isolation. Unless you've done the work, you don't know much about how it's actually done. And for people who go into the mines every day carrying a lunch bucket and a safety pack and not much more than that, what are the primary safety issues that they face?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mining has always been one of the most dangerous jobs, less so now because of safety regulations. How has life changed for miners?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You talked about some of the technological equipment that can monitor everything from air quality to the depth of the mine. How has that changed the nature of this work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If these 13 miners were able to barricade themselves in some sort of air pocket, what kind of equipment would they have with them right now to get them through these hours while they wait for the rescue crews?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Today we heard that there were great concerns now about carbon monoxide. Should we assume that they have some sort of respiratory device to protect themselves against that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how are things at your place? Any damage from the flooding?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For the first time, your poll showed only a bare majority of those surveyed supporting the president's conduct of the war. How significant was the drop?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does that tell us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was their approval rating for President Bush overall?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of the things that you're reporting is for the first time more than half of respondents said they had deployed in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Will you explain that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think is causing the shift of opinion on how the troops feel about the success in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's start by talking a little bit about your breaking point. When did you first realize that your life was just moving way too fast?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you make the case, though, to business who are looking at a bottom line? They seem to be moving away from, you know, slowing down. They want higher productivity, less leave, they don't want to pay overtime. You know, how do you balance those two cultures, if you will?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's start with someone we've already been following a bit this year, golfer Michelle Wie. She made her pro debut in the fall but didn't really live up to expectations. What's she up to now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's another emerging athlete with an interesting story, the tennis player Sania Mirza. Can you tell us a little about her?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's the controversy about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what does she wear? Is it something outrageous?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And now to talk a little bit about the business side of sports, businesswoman Sheila Johnson bought a WNBA team this year, the Washington Mystics. How many teams does she have a piece of now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How is the WNBA doing overall? How old is the league now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Like what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Finally, Tandaleya Wilder, the Winter Olympics are just around the corner. Who should we be keeping an eye out for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A guy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So where did the name Human Jukebox come from?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the roots of this date back to the '90s when it was then called a Group of 7 and the Group of 7 invited Boris Yeltsin to come to their summit as an observer. Why did that happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why don't they participate fully?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So doesn't that make it a bit odd that they're now assuming the chairmanship of this organization?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In the `We were wondering' category goes this question: Why are there a gazillion Christmas songs but only one New Year's song? In fact, ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, just announced the most performed holiday songs of the past five years and \"Auld Lang Syne\" didn't make the list by a long shot. We thought we'd pose the question to one of America's premiere songwriters, Burt Bacharach. Want a venture a guess?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Commentator Andrew Lam's latest book is \"Perfume Dreams: Reflections on the Vietnamese Diaspora.\" This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel. Two items now about borrowing, one macro and one micro. In a moment we'll hear what people who watch the bond market make of a phenomenon called an inversion that took place this week; long-term interest rates dropped below short-term rates. But, first: borrowing, as millions of Americans do it with their credit cards. New regulations will drastically increase minimum payments. Robert Manning, who joins us from Rochester, New York, is the author of \"Credit Card Nation.\" And, Mr. Manning, first of all, what are these new regulations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the ostensible point of these regulations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just out of curiosity, has any particular lender taken a bad hit with all of those bad credit card debts being taken off their books?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when do the new regulations actually take effect? In which statement will credit cardholders see these new numbers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And now on to borrowing on a bigger scale. Yesterday, for the first time in five years, interest on long-term bonds dropped below interest on short-term notes. It's not supposed to work that way. If you assume the added risk of lending your money for a longer period of time, you should be able to demand a higher rate of interest. So what does this so-called inversion mean? That's our question for John Lonski, who's chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. Mr. Lonski, what's your explanation of this inversion?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...you say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I mean, we've had so many economic reports of big economic growth in 2005. We're under the impression that we're in full recovery in the economy. Where does all of this uncertainty come from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how certain an omen is this sort of inversion? The Wall Street Journal reports that when it happens, it often precedes a recession. Often? Always? Sometimes? What would you say?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So on a scale of one to 10--these are my own metrics. On a scale of one to 10, where one is pretty flaky day in December and 10 is `Watch out, the crash is coming in the next year,' what number do you assign what's happened here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the legacy of all this for you? Now you lead an essentially secular life at this stage. You're a historian with a PhD from Emory University. What's left of it for you? What remains? What's the residue?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What did you do today to celebrate the holiday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So did you have a big load of last-minute gifts to deliver today?"}

Those are the traditional Hannukah pancakes just greasy enough to evoke the miracle of the oil. Some of you may be frying them right now. But for many Jews this year poses a bit of a dilemma. It's the first time since 1959 that Hanukkah has begun on Christmas night. Now that's the night many American Jews follow another time-honored tradition, Chinese food and a movie. Randy Cohen is who we typically turn to help us deal with life's tough questions. So, Randy, are you on the line with us now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell me, what is an American Jew to do tonight?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, help us understand the question of domestic spying that's come to light. Now the president says the domestic surveillance program is necessary and legal. From your understanding, is it legal?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The president today, though, several times did say that civil liberties protections are in place in this domestic surveillance program. Would you agree with him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Beyond civil liberties questions, there's also the question of executive power. And in addition to the president's statements today, where he says he is justified in approving the NSA to actually conduct this domestic surveillance program, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales says that when Congress authorized the use of military force after 9/11, that that was tantamount to giving the president broad powers to order domestic spying. He's essentially saying Congress gave the White House the thumbs up on this. Did it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But that joint resolution did grant the president, quote, \"all necessary and appropriate force to fight al-Qaeda.\" And it appears that the administration is focusing on that first word, `all.' Would that, indeed, grant them this latitude?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just one last question on the domestic surveillance program. For those who were made uncomfortable by this, who feel it's a violation of civil liberties or, as some assert, an actual violation of the law, what can you do about that since this is an executive order?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You heard the president in his radio address. We heard him last night. We heard him again today at the White House. Has he made his case? Has he convinced you that this is necessary?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what kind of plane was this?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You do this every day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I was wondering how you knew what the maintenance schedule was. How did you find that out?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mark Peplow, you work for an esteemed scientific journal. Would you recommend consulting these encyclopedias on scientific topics?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You've also surveyed about a thousand scientists who publish papers in Nature to find out what they knew about Wikipedia. What did you find there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want to start by asking you about the shooting last week in Southern China by Chinese police. These were villagers who were protesting that their land was being taken by the government to build a power plant. Does this fit into a pattern of rural unrest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Was the response by the authorities unusual there in that lethal firepower was used with deadly results?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you figure that they're becoming more and more aware of the rights they have through technology, through cell phones, the Internet, things like that?"}

Delegates to an international climate meeting in Montreal salvaged two weeks of negotiations by agreeing today to keep talking about ways to curb global warming. The meeting was the biggest since the Kyoto Treaty to fight global warming was signed in 1997. That treaty sets limits on so-called greenhouse gases that expires in 2012 and won't do much to stop the warming trend in the atmosphere. NPR's Christopher Joyce is just back from the Montreal meeting an joins us now. Hello, Chris. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE reporting: Hi, Debbie. How much was finally accomplished at this meeting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's been a lot of talk about US opposition to this treaty. What role did the US government play?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did you want this song on the album?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A lot of teen-agers don't necessarily get along with their parents. Was that a way for you guys to come together without having to deal with all that other stuff when you were playing music?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of the hardest moments I read from your liner notes on this album was after your father was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and he started to lose muscle control. Can you tell us that story?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what information did he provide and then later recant?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did he recant? What reason did he give?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So he recants his statement. The CIA withdraws the intelligence based on his remarks. Does that at all change the assertions made by the administration?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And before the CIA actually withdrew their intelligence, were there people raising flags about this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what does all this say about the current administration's use and reliance on third-party countries to conduct these interrogations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what happened to Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now we're talking about Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams as the co-founder of the Crips, but when the gang got started back in the 1960s, they were originally known as the Baby Avenues or Baby Cribs. How did they later become known as the Crips?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Alonso, I'd like to bring this back to Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams. Before he was catapulted to the front page of the paper in this clemency battle, if you were to sit down and talk with a group of gang members today in a place like Compton or South Central, would they see Tookie Williams as a founding father, as the OG?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how do you do that? What does the training say to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So would it be the act of physically reaching into a bag that would prompt the use of deadly force then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would the marshals--if they are going to shoot, would they always use deadly force? Would there ever be a case when they would use disabling force, say?"}

Tomorrow, an essay from Senator John Kerry, who lays out his exit strategy for getting out of Iraq. In the White House National Strategy for Victory in Iraq, the 35-page document that was released last week, the description of victory over the longer term reads as follows: `Iraq is peaceful, united, stable and secure, well-integrated into the international community and a full partner in the global war on terrorism.' Well, that second adjective, `united,' is a relative term. Peter Galbraith, who's the former US ambassador to Croatia and has been a political adviser to the Iraqi Kurds, has written this: `Although it was certainly not his intention, George W. Bush broke up Iraq when he ordered the invasion in 2003.' Peter Galbraith joins us from Bergen, Norway. And, Ambassador Galbraith, is Iraq about to break up the way that Yugoslavia, where you served in the past, broke up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In terms of the gap between Sunnis and Shiites, I'd like you to elaborate on what you wrote in The New York Review of Books recently when you were writing about the negotiations on a new constitution. You said, `Small concessions cannot paper over the differences between the victims of horrific atrocities and those who deny that any crimes took place.' Who denies that any crimes took place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think of that list of descriptions of victory in Iraq in the longer term; peaceful, united, stable, secure? Any of it possible?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, as someone who's been deeply involved in Iraq and was the US ambassador to Croatia, you have invoked the comparison to the old Yugoslavia and the position the US took trying to hold that federal system together, to no avail in the end. What should the US be doing right now? Should it be abetting the breakup into a loose confederation of what is now an aspiring unified state? Should it be trying to hold things together better than it is?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you're convinced that short of a brutal dictator, there's nothing that could hold these component parts together as a truly unified state of Iraq?"}

He's joining us by phone from Istanbul in Turkey, but in November, he was embedded with the Marines in Fallujah for a week. And I wonder, Scott Peterson, first of all, whether the kind of mission that we've heard described, the mission that proved fatal for 10 Marines, rings a bell with you. Is this what you saw Marines doing in Fallujah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you get a sense from the Marines whom you were reporting on when you were embedded as to whether they really enjoyed the cooperation of the Sunni Muslims from Fallujah? When they went on these patrols, did they have good intelligence? Did they regard the people who lived there as friends, or was every person they faced a potential foe?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've heard President Bush and others distinguish among the different groups of people who are attacking US forces or, for that matter, the new Iraqi forces in Iraq; some of them former regime elements, other old Baathists, other are jihadists. In Fallujah, is it clear who's doing this sort of thing?"}

This past June a 44-year-old colonel in the US Army, Ted Westhusing, was found dead in a trailer on a military base in Baghdad. The Army investigated and ruled his death a suicide. Westhusing had a single gunshot wound to the head. Weeks before, he had reported allegations about corruption by a US contractor in Iraq, a contractor he was responsible for overseeing. Los Angeles Times reporter T. Christian Miller has been investigating Colonel Westhusing's death and questions that remain. And first, tell us a bit about Colonel Westhusing's background. Who was he? Mr. T. CHRISTIAN MILLER (Los Angeles Times): Colonel Westhusing was a very interesting figure in the military. He was one of a handful of US officers who actually had a PhD in philosophy, and he used that PhD to return to West Point, where he was an instructor in English and philosophy and taught ethics. And it was clear from my reporting that ethics and issues of morality were very important to him. He volunteers to go to Iraq. What was his specific role there? What was he doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the company he was overseeing, what was that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about these corruption allegations. This past May, Colonel Westhusing got an anonymous four-page letter, allegations of wrongdoing by this company, USIS. What was in the letter? What were the specifics?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So these allegations come to the colonel. What happens then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is not long before the colonel is found dead in his trailer, and there's a note next to his bed. What did that note say?"}

What do Arizonans think should be done about illegal immigration?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When Arizonans think about immigration from across the border, coming in from Mexico, are they thinking about people who come to live and avail themselves of services, or are they thinking about people who come to do jobs nobody else is doing in Arizona?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do people in Arizona actually think that there is a likely solution somewhere at the horizon to the issue of illegal immigration, or is it simply--are people resigned to a fact of life that there are going to be millions crossing the border without proper documents?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it an issue that cuts differently among different ethnic groups in Arizona?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now something did pass. What was that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Ethics was big on the agenda for the legislative special session as well. And the Legislature actually approved a new code that deals with who can profit from the hurricane rebuilding contracts. Is this a push to sort of say, `That was our history. This is the new Louisiana'?"}

Nearly three months after Hurricane Katrina struck and two months to the day after Hurricane Rita hit Texas and Louisiana, there are some very special Thanksgiving gatherings all along the Gulf Coast. Mark McMurry is hosting one of them. He's the administrator for Calcasieu Parish in western Louisiana. Rita did some of its worst damage there. Mark McMurry joins us.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it possible on, say, a food budget of under $200 a month to feed, let's say, two young children well so that they are not suffering from the diet they receive?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Does that amount to an acknowledgement that Sunni Arabs--who in Iraq today are, say, attacking US forces--are conducting acts of resistance, which are, therefore, justified?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about this issue of a timetable, saying that the Iraqis want to have some timetable from the US about withdrawal? Do they mean dates when our forces will be out by?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this a problem that's happened because of the war or after the war, or was this happening prior?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As we begin our conversation, we should note that today is actually the 60th anniversary of the Nuremberg trials, the trials of Nazi war criminals that paved the way for this kind of historical reckoning. Is the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal serving the same purpose?"}

They behave a lot like other children. They'll disobey. They'll get in fights, call each other names. What is it about the idea of this sibling relationship that appealed to you?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've been witnessing serious divisions in Republican ranks on Capitol Hill all week over what to spend on, what to tax less. How do you think conservatives might change that debate if they heeded the guidance of you and your co-author?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You write, despite the fact that families with children are among the most reliable Republican constituencies, President Bush has done surprisingly little to address their needs. And you imagine a program to encourage large families, like the one in Quebec. What's conservative about that, handing out benefits to families with more children?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If indeed the era of starve-the-beast conservatism is at or nearing an end, I'm just curious, was there some moment when it hit you, when you felt it won't work anymore?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Help me understand something. Do you, on general principle, oppose these tax cuts, or are you opposed to cutting taxes at a time where the Senate is also talking about cutting programs that help the working poor?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now on the other side of this argument--I'll play devil's advocate with you--Republicans say that not to extend the Bush tax cut is riskier, perhaps even irresponsible for the economy, because it has a stimulative effect on the economy. What do you say to that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Karen Hughes, what are the biggest challenges you face in this campaign? And why are you confident that you'll have more success than your predecessors in changing the way that the Arab and the Muslim world views the United States?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, when you say the situation in Iraq improves, do you think that people in that region look at Iraq and see improvement, see progress?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Karen Hughes, you've helped the president out of many a rough spot, and the White House is going through one heck of a rough patch right now. Approval ratings are falling, support for the war is falling, as well. Did the White House paint itself into a bit of a corner in tying the case for war so closely to the search for weapons of mass destruction, a search that thus far has come up empty?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why is support for the war waning so much at this point, and what does the White House have to do to win back the public support?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Before we let you go, Karen Hughes, when you travel the globe and people ask you, `What is the US objective in Iraq? What are you trying to achieve, and what would constitute a victory there?' what's your answer to that question?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This is not exactly, though, what you were calling for. You had to hammer this out and make some compromises. How difficult was it for you to settle on what you actually passed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'd like to move on, if I could, to the treatment of terror suspects and detainees at Guantanamo. The Democrats here, I guess you could say, won here on getting Guantanamo detainees the right to appeal to actions of the military tribunals to the federal courts. Critics say that this doesn't go far enough. They say that these prisoners still exist in a zone where laws that normally govern society just don't apply. What else could have been done here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now all this has to be worked out in negotiations with the House on the defense bill. With either of these measures pass?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What items, then, are conservatives maybe likely to give up?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, it seems that moderates in Congress in both parties really have been somewhat sidelined in recent years, and now they're clearly feeling more powerful. Do you see, though, that they are a cohesive bloc that might swing their weight around on other issues, or is this just about fiscal policy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So do you expect the House to vote on its budget package this week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Good, thanks. Can you tell me, first, who are you writing this book for? I mean, is your target audience, you know, a more educated immigrant, or are you really writing for maybe that stereotypical low-wage worker?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, there's certainly a lot of people in this country who maybe don't have documents; they're here illegally. You write about them, as well. What do you suggest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of business?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " By writing about undocumented workers and basically giving them advice, I mean, are you worried about being accused of aiding and abetting in some way here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And are those--is that the way a job interview might go in Latin America?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You got into this because when you became a mom, you had a little idea and turned your invention into reality. Can you tell me about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK. So talk me through this. All right. Say, we've got an idea--I'm going to throw something out here. I want to share the profits if this works. All right? A baby--say, you know, the kid who puts applesauce in their hair every night. A baby cap to put it on during mealtime. Right? It's going to make you rich. You have this idea. What's the next step?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK. So if it's not there, what do you do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you need, though, your own patent to move ahead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " All right. Well, let's say you do all this research and there is no, you know, say, baby hair cap for mealtime out there and you want to make, you know, an example, a prototype or something to shop around. How do you do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you give me a few other examples of moms who've used their experience and found just the thing that people needed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And the other example?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much money do you hope to save through this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there are other schools in your area that are taking similar steps?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. What has the parent reaction been?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm. You know, the idea of sending notes home, telling parents to put sweaters on their kids in winter in Buffalo, am I crazy to think that they might come already in a sweater?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I take it Abu Musab al-Zarqawi has long expressed a desire to expand his jihad. Were you surprised when he apparently succeeded this week in Jordan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And fighting for what? I mean, if the idea of attacks in Iraq is to, you know, hit the American troops, why attack in Jordan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do they want to topple the regime and the monarchy in Jordan?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you give us a bit of background on Zarqawi? I mean, he was born in Jordan. How did he and his followers come to be in Iraq in the first place?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So presumably Zarqawi would never have gone to Iraq if he didn't think the Americans were going there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Zarqawi's group has put out statements explaining this week's attacks in Jordan by saying that they hit hotels that were favorite places for the work of the intelligence organs, the Americans, Israelis and Western European countries. But more than half of those killed were Jordanians, and we've seen a very emotional, angry response from citizens there. I mean, is it likely these attacks may backfire?"}

Thousands of police deployed in the center of Paris today. NPR's Adam Davidson has been traveling through two of the hardest-hit areas around Paris and in Lille. He joins me now. Hi, Adam. ADAM DAVIDSON reporting: Hi, Jennifer. So things seem a lot quieter now. As the French look back on these two weeks, is there some sense that this violence took them by surprise?"}

One of the seven, Michael Fitzgerald, joins us from Dunedin, Florida. And, Mr. Fitzgerald, what were you fired for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This concerns bulk business mail, which you would carry and deliver to your customers?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " In Dover, Pennsylvania, a fight over including what's called intelligent design in the science curriculum led to an overhaul of the school board in yesterday's election. Eight members of the board, all Republicans who supported the introduction of intelligent design, were voted out of office. They'll be replaced by eight challengers, who campaigned against the policy, and all ran as Democrats. Intelligent design argues that the universe is so complex that Darwinian evolution can't explain it and a higher force must have designed it. Critics say intelligent design is simply creationism, a wolf entering the curriculum in sheep's clothing. The debate has created sharp divisions in Dover. Christina Kauffman has been covering the story for the York Dispatch. And, Ms. Kauffman, was the election result last night a surprise, all these eight incumbents voted out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mentioned Dover CARES. These are the new board members. They ran as a slate. What do they say about intelligent design? What do they think about it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And have they said--do they plan to reverse the policy as it stands now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now all of this is being challenged in federal court, the first legal test, as I understand it, for intelligent design, and the trial ended just last week. What does the judge have to decide?"}

She was talking about the election results in Dover, Pennsylvania, where supporters of intelligent design were voted off the school board yesterday. Tonight, residents of Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana could be in for more severe weather like the storm that caused a deadly tornado on Sunday. That twister killed 22 people. It struck in the middle of the night, not to mention late in the season, and it caught residents off guard. Ed Kieser is a meteorologist at member station WILL in Urbana, Illinois. And, Mr. Kieser, how unusual are these storms this late in the season?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is it the kind of thing that people would be expecting, though, tornados in the spring and summer, so by the time November comes around, they may not take warnings too seriously?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. The storm that hit this weekend formed late at night. Do tornados that strike at night form in a different way than tornados that come during the daytime?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what conditions would those be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is the forecast as you're heading into tonight for these parts of the upper Midwest, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just from a source of basic riot control and police work, where are the French gendarmes, the French police?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, with this spreading from Paris to Normandy and down to the south, one would think that the country's president would be saying more. Hasn't French President Jacques Chirac been pretty quiet?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just because I think it's fun, and speaking of simply having fun, would you read \"The Flock\" from this new collection?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I love that poem. One of the things you're credited with, Billy Collins--and I think deservedly so--is having a lot of whimsy and putting a lot of fun into poetry. Is there something troubled with poetry? Is it considered by some readers to be too esoteric?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But what would the world be without poetry? Do you know?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I think what I love about this poem is it takes me right to the heart of what it is that a poet does, where the sheet of paper becomes the pane of glass the poet's looking out of. In other words, you're doing that essential task of experiencing and then conveying emotion. But are we right in detecting a sort of a common element in this collection in which you are thinking about the passage of time?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " John, how did you find this all out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And there's a link to the series John Bull has done at our Web site, npr.org. You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. The road between Baghdad International Airport and the city has long been the most dangerous stretch of highway in Iraq. Suicide bombers and roadside explosions produced a steady death toll along the corridor, and the road's pockmarked pavement stood as a grim reminder of the military's struggle to blunt a growing insurgency. But in recent weeks, the killings have all but stopped. No Americans were killed on the road last week, and only one person was injured. To find out what's behind this turnaround, we turn to Jackie Spinner. She reported the story for The Washington Post and joins us from Baghdad. Jackie, how did this road go from being a highway of peril to a relatively safe passageway?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I understand this was such a problem for the military that they put one person specifically in charge of securing that road; his name was Lieutenant Colonel Michael Harris. Can you tell us a little bit about him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jackie, to say the road is now safer, what exactly does that mean? What do the statistics tell us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So the military sees this as a victory, but did they actually just push the problem elsewhere?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's happening on that road?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as the defense attorney, would you be thinking, you know, the best defense here is an `I just didn't remember' case, a confused memory, `I'm a very busy, high-government official, and this is not intentional; it's just a pure lapse of memory'?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, if you think about these perjury counts and the false statements counts against Lewis Libby, there's a lot of specificity in this indictment. It's not just one thing he said to one investigator, and especially when he testifies about his conversation with Tim Russert of NBC. There are whole paragraphs of specific things that he said that Tim Russert had told him. Doesn't that make his defense more complicated, that it wasn't just one throwaway line; it was line after line after line?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You are?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about a grand jury, though?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If Lewis Libby were convicted on all counts, he could get a 30-year sentence. Do you see any room for a plea bargain here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Karl Rove and his role in all of this--he's denied that he played a central role in talking to journalists about Valerie Plame, and it appears that that is not true. When will he explain what actually happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much of a distraction is this for the White House?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But on this question of focus, how do you remain focused and effective when the person in charge of communicating information from the White House, Scott McClellan, is--faces a barrage of questions about his own credibility every time he tries to hold a press conference?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now in 2003, Scott McClellan said categorically that Lewis Libby was not involved in the leak. And at this point, how does he restore his own credibility so that you can effectively communicate the business of the White House until he explains what some call `misstatements' and what others are calling outright lies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Pardon me, I'm not trying tussle with you on this, but it is very clear now that Lewis Libby and Karl Rove did have conversations with reporters about Valerie Plame. Is that appropriate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito continues to make the rounds on Capitol Hill. It appears that his nomination has been better received by many of the president's supporters than the previous nomination. But as you look beyond the conservative base, how do you, as a communications director, deal with the disappointment among many who point out that there's never been an Hispanic justice, that women, who were already underrepresented on the court, are even more so now that their numbers have been cut in half?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Serious consequences. What might that include?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it's a strong message, strongly worded resolution, but the penalty is somewhat ambiguous. Does that weaken the UN's hand?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The UN inquiry, prepared by Detlev Mehlis, suggests that members of President Bashar Al-Assad's inner circle may have been involved in this killing. Do you think responsibility for this attack reaches all the way to his office?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And in looking at where that evidence points right now, do you think it reaches the president's office?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as for the investigation into the killing of Rafik Hariri, what is the UN specifically asking Syria to do? What constitutes `cooperation'?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Some Arab leaders have warned that putting too much pressure on Syria could backfire; could destabilize the government, leading to utter chaos or a coup. And that could then set the stage for the rise of a fundamentalist Islamic regime. Do you share those concerns?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just prior to the passage of this resolution, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said, `With our decision today, we show that Syria has isolated itself from the international community through its false statements, its support for terrorism, its interference in the affairs of its neighbors and its destabilizing behavior in the Middle East.' Now some say that they see parallels between this resolution and the resolutions against Iraq leading up to the war there. If diplomatic channels lead nowhere, is there a possibility of military action against Syria?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How long do you let the UN process proceed, and at what point does the US step up and work outside of that process, get ahead of it if necessary?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But, Ambassador, the US--the international community, in fact, has been putting pressure on Syria for some time. So I'm guess I'm asking you how willing--how patient are you willing to be?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You write that for their size, crows are among the brainiest organisms on Earth. You say they outclass not only other birds but also most mammals?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you know that they're smart? I mean, what tips you off to know that, because they have this big brain, that it's working?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It's a pretty dark image of a crow in that poem, and that's something that we're seeing a lot right now. It's Halloween weekend, and you're seeing the crow pop up on the seasonal aisle at stores and some people have them in their scary front-yard displays. Where does that come from, that crows are a little bit scary?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell us a little bit about Santo. He wasn't the only masked movie star, but he was probably the most famous in Mexico. And in your book, you compare him to John Wayne?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's your favorite Mexican wrestler film?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Happy Halloween. I'm Debbie Elliott, and that's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. We'll be checking in with editors around the country to gauge national reaction to the political woes of the White House, but first, there was a series of what appeared to be terrorist attacks today in the Indian capital New Delhi. More than 50 people were reported killed when three bombs went off. Two hit marketplaces that were packed with shoppers preparing for the biggest Hindu and Muslim festivals of the year. NPR's Philip Reeves is following the story from outside Jaipur, India. He joins me now. Hi, Phil. PHILIP REEVES reporting: Hi. Has there been any claim of responsibility? Do we know for sure that this was an act of political terrorism?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now a few years ago, the Indian parliament was bombed and Pakistani-backed militants were blamed. At that time, the tensions between India and Pakistan got so bad that people were actually talking about nuclear war, but relations have been better lately, haven't they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These attacks appear to have possibly been coordinated in that they happened in a very close time span, like some of the al-Qaeda-type bombings that we've seen in recent years. Is there any thought that this could possibly be the work of al-Qaeda?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now what did you think when you first read \"Summer Crossing\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now we should fill our listeners in. \"Summer Crossing\" is the story of a New York debutante and the summer that she has a secret affair with a Jewish parking lot attendant. And the novel does sort of echo this theme of class that was at \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" and some of Capote's other works. But I get the sense that he was much younger when he wrote this. How old was he?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So this was before he maybe had that entree into the penthouses of Manhattan socialites that he later had. What do you think was drawing him into this world?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think scholars are going to be interested in this work or do you think just average readers who like Capote's storytelling?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Finally, Mr. Schwartz, I'd like to know what you think Truman Capote would have made of this sudden resurgence of fame, the movie out, now this book?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You write today, Anthony, about an orchestrated protest in the Syrian capital. What's the general mood on the street in light of this report?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you talk to figures within the Syrian opposition, splintered as they may be, do they see this as a moment of opportunity, or is this more a moment when people will tend to galvanize around the government, around the power structure?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you see the Syrian government itself responding to this pressure? You've got now France and the United States and the German investigator, Mr. Mehlis, saying, `Syrian government, stop obstructing; start cooperating.' Does the government cooperate? Do they reject the findings, or do they try to figure out some way to go along with this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how destabilizing could this be then for the government of Bashar al-Assad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Anisa Mehdi is a filmmaker based in Maplewood, New Jersey. Chuck Clapp joins us now from Key West, Florida. And, Chuck, how bad was Hurricane Wilma where you were?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It did come in fast. Did the water go down some pretty quickly, too?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now why did you decide to stay and ride this one out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much cleanup do you have to do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Chuck, was there a moment during this storm when you thought, `Boy, maybe we made the wrong decision to stay. We really should have gotten off the island'?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now do you figure you've seen the end of this hurricane season in Key West?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you been able to speak to people who were stranded there during the height of the storm?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Because that storm did slow down and stay over that area for so long, it was just inundated with rain. We've heard reports of flash flooding and people being in dire conditions. Is the water still there, or is it starting to recede?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. Have seen a presence of the military there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This area that was hit by the storm is very important to the economy there because of the tourist business there. Do you have a sense that this could be a real big financial blow for that area?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Up to this point, what protection have these defense attorneys had?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why were the defense lawyers a target?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why did the lawyers reject the security that was offered to them by the Iraqi interior ministry?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who was the lawyer that was killed this week. The trial is now in recess until November 28th. Do you think it will be safe to resume the proceedings then given this murder?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have any of them said in these past couple of days what their plans are? Are they afraid to continue defending these men?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have a copy of the English version of the preamble in front of you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you mind reading me the first paragraph?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Later, it also seems a little dark. It refers to the pains of sectarian oppression, the tragedies of Iraq's martyrs, the ravage of the holy cities, the grief of mass graves. What's the overall tone as Iraqis read that part?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there anything in here that clues you to think that maybe this document had not been written entirely by Iraqis?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Were you able to make any judgment or inference as to whether this struck the American soldiers as something unusual or something that might have happened routinely in their service?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'm good. It seems Iraqis have endorsed this referendum, but could the vote go the other way once all the ballots are in?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've heard American leaders weigh in on this vote--the president, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Has there been any reaction there from Iraqi politicians?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about irregularities? You had mentioned that some Sunni Arabs were saying that there were problems. Can you update us on any official reports of what may have happened at the polls?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've seen reports that some Sunni leaders are upset with what they're hearing from US officials--in particular, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was quoted as saying that, you know, while the vote count was in process, saying that the constitution had probably passed, and they read that as sort of pressure on Iraq to make sure that it does pass. Have you been hearing anything like that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were in Sunni areas today. There was a lot of concern about the constitution among the Sunnis. They boycotted the last vote and there were conflicting messages this time from Sunni leaders about whether to vote. What can you say about the turnout?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did they tell you why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did you get a sense from the Sunnis what was motivating them to vote?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're now in Balad, which is mainly Shiite, but it's surrounded by Sunni towns. Can you compare the moods?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The White House maintains that it does not pay attention to polls, even as they've been slipping for some time. Today, a new survey by The Pew Research Center finds an even more significant decline in the public's view of the president and the job he's doing. Andy Kohut, director of the center, joins me now to explain. Andy, what's changed--Or shall we say worsened?--about the president's standing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How much of this is tied to the war in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Hurricane Katrina only affected one region of the country. You mentioned that as a possible factor. Questions were raised about competence and cronyism in the administration's handling of this. Did that affect these numbers, and did it bring people who perhaps in previous polls had given the president high marks and have now changed their mind based on what they saw?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, Andy, how do your findings compare with other polls, other surveys?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " I want you to give us some context of what's happened here in terms of Pakistan and President Musharraf's leadership. Would this be seen by people as a general test of the effectiveness of the regime in Islamabad? Is it assumed that no regime would do very well under these circumstances? What's your general impression?"}

Thirteen floating casinos along the Gulf Coast were damaged or destroyed when Hurricane Katrina blew through in August, tossing the ships and barges on shore like toys in a basement playroom. This week Governor Haley Barbour will sign a bill that will allow the casinos to rebuild on shore. Emily Wagster Pettus covers the Mississippi Legislature for the Associated Press and joins us now. Emily, what was the debate over this bill like?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so now that the bill has passed, on its way to a signature from the governor, what's the reaction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Emily, just help us understand something. Why were casinos restricted from building on land in the first place?"}

We're about 60 miles out from the eye of Hurricane Rita. We're flying through--over the cloud tops right now, and looking out the window, you can actually see some of the feeder bands on the western side of the storm. So you can actually see the feeder bands. You're pretty close there to the hurricane. What exactly is the mission? What do they hope to achieve?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You can see pictures and read an excerpt from \"Galveston and the 1900 Storm\" and find NPR's extensive coverage of Hurricane Katrina at our Web site, npr.org. That's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Debbie Elliott. Joining us from his office in Washington, DC, is former Democratic Senator from Louisiana John Breaux. Welcome back to the program, Senator Breaux. Former Senator JOHN BREAUX (Democrat, Louisiana): Sure. Thank you. Seems to be something of an argument developing over what's happened in Washington in recent years with regard to Louisiana. On the one hand, we have it frequently said that your state didn't get the kind of funding it needed for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair levees. On the other hand, we have a story in The Washington Post today which says Louisiana got more money than anybody else in the country and often used it for things that weren't as important as fixing the levees. What's your sense of the controversy?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But was there ever actually a proposal? You and your colleagues on the Hill, from Louisiana, were forever proposing projects for Louisiana. Was there ever a bill which, had it been funded, would have replaced the specific levee that broke under the force of Katrina last week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Senator Landrieu, Mary Landrieu, a former colleague, senator from Louisiana, said today in a speech on the floor of the Senate, `Washington rolled the dice and Louisiana lost.' Is that accurate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There is a poll out today from the Pew Center which finds that a a remarkable number of Americans feel either depressed or angry, or have felt that way over the past week, about what's happened with Hurricane Katrina. I just wonder how you feel, I mean, as somebody who was talking in the Senate for many, many years about levees in New Orleans. And, as you say, you, along with everybody, feel like you could have done more. What has it been like the past week?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...Andy. And first, how closely have people been following Katrina?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As a pollster, would you expect those priorities to flip back, or do you think you see a trend there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President's approval rating, what do you find?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What, to you, is the question in all this that comes closest to the national thermometer? You know, do people feel good about things or bad about things? You don't ask a right track, wrong track question here in your survey, but what do you see here that tells you which way you think things are going?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Andrew Kohut, director of The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. Christine Francis is from New Orleans. She's employed by a company that works on computer systems for the mayor's office. For most of her extended family, home is the largely still-flooded 9th Ward of the city. Refuge for the family this week is a hotel in Austin, Texas. Christine Francis, how big is the family and why are you in Austin, Texas?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why Austin? Why did you go there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now so far as you know, everybody in the family is well and has survived the disaster?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now in terms of property loss, what has the extended family lost in the 9th Ward?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So in terms of the homeowners in the family, how many homes were lost?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Nine homes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there insurance to cover it? Do you get some special benefit from FEMA? Well, what happens now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Apart from federal assistance or state assistance, is there any insurance assistance?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your home is under water?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " A DNA sample?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Hargrove, do you have the help you need to do your job right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you have any sense of how long it might be before you've been able to identify all of the bodies in your county?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Hargrove, I imagine as a coroner you have to steel yourself against the deaths that you see on a regular basis. But I do wonder, especially as someone who lives in that community in Gulfport, whether this is just something that's too hard to bear at times?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what's the latest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And when you say the breach has been closed, is that with sandbags?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now how do you go about pumping out the water when you have no power?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now has any of this pumping started yet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has that begun? Has that had any success?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mr. Naomi, do you have any way of estimating how long it'll be before the city and the surrounding area are dry?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You think it could be weeks?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When did you get those e-mails?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Oh, so there was a period there where you just didn't know at all what was going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did you handle that? What did you do when you just didn't know whether they were safe or not?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hm. Where have they gone?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And are they staying in shelters or with family?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have people there who are from New Orleans, from the area, been glued to the television watching what's going on, trying to figure out what the situation is there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how have you handled that when you see what the situation is? What's that like for you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have you heard about when you will be going home?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are there people there who would want to go home right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " It appears the White House and its allies in the Senate want to proceed with the hearings on the Roberts nomination this week. Why is that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Don, the president's under growing political pressure now: eroding support for the war in Iraq, high gas prices and now this stinging criticism of the federal response to Hurricane Katrina. Does this affect his choice to succeed Justice Rehnquist?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why are they crippled?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There seems to be an assumption that if you prepare for a terrorist attack that you'll also be prepared for a natural disaster. Do you think that's the case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've heard the mayor of New Orleans complaining about several problems: a lack of communication ability between authorities on the ground, some chain-of-command issues. Do you think these are issues because there isn't that planning and disaster preparedness interaction going on between the federal, the state and the local officials?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did you get the baby out when you were trying to swim?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you know what you're going to do? Are you going to try to find work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, do you need to go take care of that baby girl?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've just heard that President Bush has ordered 7,000 more active-duty troops to New Orleans, 10,000 more National Guard are heading that way to the coast. Are you satisfied with that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think the federal government should be doing right now to help those people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Your colleague, Mississippi Congressman Bennie Thompson, has called for the resignation of Mike Brown, the head of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Do you endorse that call?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, I've heard talk from some people, including a lot of people who are in Louisiana and have gotten out of New Orleans maybe, they've been saying that this crisis has exposed some of our country's deepest-seeded problems. Problems of race, problems of poverty, problems of poor health care. Do you think this is revealing something that--issues that have not been taken care of in our country?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What kind of problems do these babies have that landed them in ICU?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was it like to know that there were these really small, helpless babies trapped in the situation in New Orleans?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How are they doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There was someone in New Jersey at The Princeton Review who was sending out messages, trying to get you help. How did they respond when you first tried to tell them that help was on the way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You don't know where they were taken?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you haven't heard from your mom's friend yet?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...Jeffrey Rosen. And to stand by what is decided is English, but this is law, so we should say instead?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And as a legal principle, what does that mean, let the decision stand?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What might be a good example of a court making a decision based not so much on its being wildly impressed with the virtues of the decision, but it is settled law?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You mean, the Supreme Court could say in Brown vs. Board of Education that separate, indeed, is not equal, and therefore the logic of the original decision no longer holds?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what does Judge Roberts have to say about stare decisis? Is he someone who would regard it as a principle of being a conservative, say, that if it's settled law, you should stand by settled law?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you spoke to me on Monday, the Coast Guard had already, I think, rescued about a hundred people and you had had a list of 200 addresses that you were trying to pinpoint and get to. Do you still have a list, and how many addresses are there on that list that you still have to get to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The first time that we spoke this week you said that after the rescue mission, beyond that the Coast Guard's mission was to clear up the shipping channels along the coast so that commerce could resume. Is there any progress on that front at all, or has that all been really put on hold while you deal with the rescue operation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mississippi is in your patch. There--I mean, if there are people who are still stranded, is the main problem figuring out where they are, the numbers of them merely or the inability to get the helicopters down on the ground near them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do your crews come back and describe finding dead bodies in buildings where they've done searches?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let me ask you about images that many Americans are seeing today and hearing about. They are from the convention center in New Orleans. A CNN reporter has described thousands of people, he says, many of them--you see them in the pictures, mothers with babies--in the streets, no food, corpses and human waste. Our reporter John Burnett has seen the same things. How many days before your operation finds these people, brings them at least food, water, medical supplies, if not gets them out of there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if those people who haven't gotten them--if they ask our reporter, `When am I going to see those supplies? When does it get to me?' --what's the answer? How many days until it reaches them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But--and what is your sense? I'm trying--I mean, by the weekend do you expect that everybody in New Orleans will have some kind of food and water delivered by this operation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Just like to ask you, there is said to have been a report in, I think, 2001 which listed a catastrophic hurricane hitting New Orleans as one of the three worst potential disasters the country could face. As someone who inherited FEMA and who came to this obviously with 9/11 being the preoccupation that faced us all, have you had a plan somewhere in an office near yours that says, `Huge hurricane hits New Orleans. Here's what we do in case of that catastrophe'?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're a mayor who is very much involved with urban planning and trying to engage your other mayors in urban planning. How different might a city emerge--how different might, say, New Orleans emerge from a hurricane? How different did Charleston come out of the hurricane from what it was before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was like that when you were inside your own home as the hurricane hit?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How are people's spirits holding up in Gulfport and in Biloxi, where we're speaking to you now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you get the sense that the beach houses and the houses on your block in Gulfport are going to be rebuilt and life is going to return and it's going to get back to normal, or, in effect, has Gulfport, Mississippi, just died in this storm?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How old was your house? When was it built?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But a great many workers have retirement plans such as 401(k)s or they've been able to take advantage of IRAs over the years. Typically, how much have people put into those plans?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this particular generation that's on the verge of retirement--and I guess technically the Bakers are a little bit older than true baby boomers. We count the boom from those born in 1946 through 1964. Is this generation especially better prepared or worse prepared for retirement than previous generations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now before we lapse completely into past tense here, there's still a possibility of a storm surge, isn't there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is anybody offering any estimate of how the recovery might go, how long it might take?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...without power?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And running water?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Could you tell us a little bit about the origins of the facility and how it came to be where it is today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Still, tell us a little bit more about Walter Reed. Who was Walter Reed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What medical advances do you associate with the hospital?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Base Closure and Realignment Commission?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Am I asking you, as a historian, to betray your confidence or judgment by asking if you think that this will, this closure, save money over the long run?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...and makes her famous and controversial. Would you tell us just a little bit of why she chose \"Vindication\" as a title, \"A Vindication of the Rights of Women\"?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where do you set her in the figures of the Enlightenment?"}

First, the head of Iraq's constitutional drafting committee said today that over three days, they're just not going to get Sunni Muslim approval, so the constitution there will have to be approved by parliament over Sunni objections and go to a referendum. Are you concerned that the constitution could be defeated in that referendum?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm John Ydstie. What were the Americas like in 1491, before Columbus landed? Our founding myths suggest the hemisphere was sparsely populated mostly by nomadic tribes living lightly on the land and that the land was, for the most part, a vast wilderness. That's what most of us learned in school, along with a few paragraphs about more highly developed cultures in Central and South America. Research of the past few decades suggests, though, that the Americas were home to more people than Europe when Columbus landed and that most lived in complex, highly organized societies. In his new book titled \"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,\" Charles C. Mann compiled evidence of the sophistication of pre-Columbian America. He joins us now from the studios of WFCR in Amherst, Massachusetts. Welcome to the program. Mr. CHARLES C. MANN (Author, \"1491\"): Glad to be here. Let's just quickly paint a picture of what the new evidence suggests that America looked like in 1491, what the Indian cultures looked like. And let's start in a very familiar place for Americans, for North Americans, and that is in New England, in the area of the Plymouth Colony. What kind of Indian society was there at the time?"}

NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is with the pontiff in Cologne. Hi, Sylvia. SYLVIA POGGIOLI reporting: Hi, John. Sylvia, this sounds like a pretty blunt message that the pope delivered today. What exactly did he say to the Muslim religious leaders?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's Alinea's chef, Grant Achatz. He sat down with us just before the doors opened one recent evening, while staff did some last-minute vacuuming and laid out menus on an elegant sideboard. Like everything here, the menus are minimalist: no prices, no description, just a series of words. One entree reads `Bison, beets, blueberries, burning cinnamon.' Burning cinnamon?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And it's not going to fall apart when I do that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Also on offer tonight: puffed lobster. Achatz describes it as a lobster-flavored Cheeto; it's surprisingly subtle. A lot of Alinea is about creating small surprises. The menu, decor and computer-programmed lighting are ever-changing. Achatz even worries utensils get boring. He's crafted little ceramic pedestals that serve as elevated spoons. Above all, if you come to Alinea, Chef Grant Achatz wants you to savor the experience as well as the food. Upstairs, in a hushed dining room, he explains the menu offers an eight-course or 12-course dinner, and then... The Tour?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You have something called the Tour that's how many courses?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How did they react when you approached them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I mean, this leads to a touchy-feely question. We've been talking about your father and your understanding of him, but have you come to understand yourself a little differently through this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, Mr. Korb, would you say the all-volunteer Army is in trouble? And if it is, how serious is it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We just heard a lieutenant colonel with the National Guard talk about the difficulty of recruiting when you're fighting what he called a `hot war.' Can the country, can the United States, fight a sustained ground war in Iraq and in Afghanistan with an all-volunteer Army if those wars are growing unpopular, increasingly unpopular?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what are some possible solutions here, would you say? If there are these military shortfalls, what would you suggest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " They've also talked about increasing bonuses for people in certain highly valued slots within the military. Is that a good idea?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is there an appetite within the Security Council to take this on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If the goal of the Iranians is, in fact, to develop nuclear weapons, how far away would you estimate they are in that process?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is this then a non-partisan issue?"}

Almost exactly five years ago, the world watched helplessly as 118 crewmen died aboard the Russian submarine Kursk. Today, US and British underwater rescue specialists have joined the Russia Pacific fleet in an attempt to rescue seven men aboard a Russian minisub. The vessel known as the AS-28 has been stranded since Thursday morning. It's 625 feet under the sea off the Kamchatski Peninsula in the Russian Far East. The US and British teams arrived today with special remote-controlled minisubs of their own. According to the latest estimate, the oxygen on board, though, won't last more than half a day. NPR's Martha Wexler is following the story from Moscow. And, Martha, do we know, first, whether these men are still alive? MARTHA WEXLER reporting: Well, Jennifer, you know, the Russian naval commanders have been saying now for the last couple of days that they are in contact with the crew and they said they heard from them just several hours ago. The spokesmen won't say exactly how they're communicating with the crew. They just say they're in technical contact and some former Navy men I've spoken to here say that that may mean that they're just sort of tapping. The men are alive. They are not panicking. They're keeping quite to cut down on their oxygen intake. It's pretty cold down there, between 41 and 44 degrees. What has been happening in the last few hours with the rescue?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, with that information, do we know anything more now about how this minisub came to get caught in the first place?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You seem to be advocating a form of behavioral profiling, but right now in the New York City subway system, the searches, as we understand it, are random; they're numerical. Do those kind of random searches work either as a deterrent or as a net to capture people who might do us harm?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now one of the things that we've seen be of issue to women in Iraq lately is the language in the new constitution, which talks about the foundation of women's rights reverting to Islamic law, which hadn't been the case under Saddam Hussein.

In Pakistan, foreign students are urging President Pervaiz Musharraf not to expel them from the country. Musharraf announced on Friday that he would ban international students from the country's Islamic schools, or madrassas. The schools have been accused of spreading extremism. At least one of the alleged suicide bombers in the July 7th London bombing attack is known to have visited a religious school in Pakistan. Joining us from Islamabad is reporter Roland Buerk, who files for the BBC. Roland Buerk, how many foreign students are studying in Pakistan at these madrassas, and where are they from?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now there's special attention, I think, being paid to the school visited by 22-year-old Shehzad Tanweer, who was born in Great Britain. He is alleged to be one of the July 7th bombers. And he visited a school last year in Lahore. Can you tell us a little bit more about that school?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " What would the Tube station look like in the morning when you arrived?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, today's arrests--only one, the police say, of a suspected bomber. Does that mean that the police think that they are arresting underlings or planners or people who assisted in the bombings last week--the attempted bombings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you make of the flight of the men who are suspected of trying to set off bombs last week, people who we assume, if they were intending to carry out suicide bombings, had no expectation of being alive after that morning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do the police now make of the possible links between the attempted bombings of July 21st and the bombings in London that did occur on July 7th?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have you heard, to you, a persuasive explanation of the simultaneous failure of, say, four explosive devices in the same morning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I'd like to ask you first of all today whether you are confident that British Muslims want to cooperate fully with the police in investigating the bombings both of last week and of two weeks before that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where does the blame rest for that failure? Is it with the larger society for not welcoming Muslims, or from Muslims not trying to integrate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Earlier this month, after the July 7th bombings, a group of imams and Muslim scholars met in London and declared that the bombers had violated the Koran by killing innocent civilians; they were not martyrs. And then in a press conference, they were pressed to say the same of suicide bombings in Iraq or Israel, and they wouldn't do so. The head of the World Islamic League described instead a special case for people trying to defend themselves from occupiers. Are you comfortable with that distinction, or does it ultimately put you on a slippery slope of justifying blowing up a bus full of people just provided they're not the people in your city?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But are you, in describing Iraq, for example, saying that somebody who might blow up a bomb in Baghdad, probably killing Muslims in the process, is doing something that is morally different from somebody blowing up a bus in London?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's just start with the man who was shot today by police in the subway. We just heard Ian Blair say that the man was challenged, refused to obey police instructions. Have you been able to learn anything more about what led to him being shot, say, as opposed to being detained by police?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There were also these closed-circuit TV images that were released today of the four suspected bombers in yesterday's bombing attempts. Any conclusions to be drawn from those images and how they may relate to the previous attackers two weeks ago?"}

There's whatever forensic evidence they've gleaned from the attacks two weeks ago. Have you learned anything about whether those explosives match, whether they seem to be the same kinds of bombs?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Martin Bright is home affairs editor of The Observer in London. Film director Roman Polanski won a libel suit in London today even though he didn't set foot in Britain for the trial. Polanski, who made \"Rosemary's Baby,\" \"Chinatown\" and \"The Pianist,\" testified by video from Paris. He was afraid that had he traveled to London, he might have been extradited to the United States. That's because Polanski fled to Europe in 1978 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl. He fled while he was awaiting sentence. The libel concerns another chapter in Polanski's life, the murder of his wife Sharon Tate in 1969 by the cult led by Charles Manson. According to Vanity Fair magazine, shortly after that, Polanski made crude sexual advances to a woman at the Manhattan literary watering hole Elaine's. Michael Horsnell of the British daily The Times covered the libel trial that pitted Polanski against the magazine's publisher Conde Nast. And Polanski won. Michael Horsnell, what exactly does he win?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What was Roman Polanski required to prove in this case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This case has unfolded in court during a period when, obviously, London has had bigger things on its mind. Has it actually been covered heavily by the papers nonetheless?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell me more about the actual confession? I mean, what does Sheik Zana, for example, say he did?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I guess this all raises the question: Is any valuable information coming out of this in terms of trying to stop the wider insurgency?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now George Hincapie was reportedly shaking his head as he crossed the finish line there today. I mean, was he surprised to win?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, now Armstrong is kind of known for his good riding in the mountains there. What--he still has a lead. What do you think his strategy is likely to be in this final week of the Tour?"}

The China National Offshore Oil Corporation, C-N-O-O-C or CNOOC (pronounced see-nook), is trying to buy the US oil company Unocal. So is Chevron. CNOOC is willing to pay more, but the Chinese company faces a hurdle that Chevron does not. For the deal to go through it would have to clear the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The C-F-I-U-S or CFIUS (pronounced sif-ee-us) is a little-known body that has representatives of 12 federal agencies. James Andrew Lewis, who directs the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Washington think tank CSIS, is the rare scholar who has actually studied and written about CFIUS, and he joins us from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tell us, who actually is on this committee?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how often does it actually review foreign investments, and what are the criteria that it applies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But ownership of an American oil company, is there a track record there? Can we tell if that's something that historically has been an interest of CFIUS?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When was the last time that a deal actually was in some way thwarted by this committee, by CFIUS?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A resolution passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 398-to-15 saying that for this Chinese company to buy Unocal would threaten to impair the national security of the United States. Is the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States by charter responsible to do what the Congress says? Should--would it naturally take into account that sentiment of the House?"}

You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. Something is missing from the coastal waters off Northern California, Oregon and Washington state: plankton. The organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain have not shown up this year in their usual numbers, and that means a wave of seabird deaths near the North Pacific coast, it also worries fisheries and we read also that it puzzles scientists. So we've called upon Bill Peterson, who is an oceanographer for NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center. Bill Peterson, are you puzzled?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What actually has not happened? What would you normally see at this time of year that you're not seeing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How often does that happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What are the species actually that are really jeopardized by this right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, if the food's not there for one summer, what does that mean? Could the impact on the coastal fish and wildlife be just one bad year and then next year the stocks are replenished, or is there a possibility of a permanent loss of fish and wildlife?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are fish that live for a hundred years off the Pacific coast?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you talk about the range between cold ocean waters and warmer ocean waters this year, what number of degrees Fahrenheit difference are we talking about here? What's the range?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " In Amsterdam, the man standing trial for the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh admitted his guilt in court today. Mohammed Bouyeri was already linked to the crime by overwhelming evidence, but even so his courtroom declaration today was stunning. Reporter Geraldine Coughlan is covering the trial of Mohammed Bouyeri for the BBC, and she joins us now from The Hague. What did Mohammed Bouyeri say in court today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, I assume that since he is not going to actually make a defense in this trial and rejects the legitimacy of the Dutch trial, he's going to be convicted pretty clearly. What's he likely to be sentenced to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And to what end? What was--all these numbers, what were they supposed to lead to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what did Henrietta Leavitt discover that helped them figure this out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. Did she ever have a sense of the importance of her discovery?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Since the US attacks of 9/11, we in this country have certainly had a debate over treating terror as a matter of intelligence or law enforcement and whether you can actually separate the two. Can I ask you, in Britain with an attack of the magnitude of this week's, what is the approach?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And does the British government take that approach then, it--this is intelligence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So do you see changes that might come out of this week's bombings?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Although we're talking about the underground system there in London, I mean, it's my understanding there are cameras throughout the system. There's been a history of attacks in the underground. What more concretely could one do to protect the underground system?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As we speak, we don't know who carried out these attacks or where they are, if they're still in England, if they've maybe left for another European country, part of the European Union where they wouldn't even have to show a passport, which brings me to a question about a pan-European intelligence operation. Do you think there will be more calls for such a thing?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now is this an increase in recent years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that why you think you're seeing this increase, that companies can't pay as much for health insurance for their employees?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now Medicaid covers health-care costs for many of the poorest Americans, but we're seeing now a number of states looking to cut their Medicaid rolls. What effect would you expect that to have on the number of women foregoing care?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " In southern Afghanistan, US forces launched air strikes today against suspected rebels. The strikes came after insurgents had attacked a joint US-Afghan patrol. The fighting is just the latest in what seems to be mounting violence by the Taliban. Afghan and US officials fear that the Taliban and its allies in al-Qaeda are regrouping as Afghanistan prepares for parliamentary elections this fall. Joining us from Kabul is Carlotta Gall of The New York Times. Carlotta, this weekend, rebels have seized some government buildings in southern Afghanistan. Can you tell us what happened?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So we've seen US air strikes today. I mean, any sense of what their larger goals are militarily speaking?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what's it like to live where the sun never sets?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do you try to stick to your normal sleep schedule?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " So are TV manufacturers going to make this deadline?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So explain the context here. I mean, why the big push from the FCC to get people to buy digital TV sets?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And then right now they have a deadline for cutting off analog, or is that also being debated?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So why though? Why are they going to cut off analog?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " OK. So what about for consumers? If you're going to go TV shopping in the next little while--this deadline's coming up week after this. What are you going to find?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if you've got an old analog TV and you don't want to go buy a new one, can you upgrade?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How should the federal government strike a balance between what you describe rather persuadingly as the inevitability of the success of some surprise attacks, and on the other hand the sense that one of the things we expect of our government is to protect us? I mean, I can't imagine people running for president or the Senate, saying, `You know, this sort of thing happens. What can we do about it?' They've got to make some good case that they can prevent this, no?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that equally effective, to say that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you suggest that people who are opening the mail in the mail room with latex gloves for fear of the white powder that might be anthrax or the people who are having their fingernail clippers confiscated at the airport because they could be weaponized, or who aren't allowed to use the rest room for the last half-hour coming into Washington, DC--that we should simply stop all this, that it really has no role in the calculus of surprise attacks?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. In the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, Kurdish police have been seizing hundreds of minority Arabs and Turkomans and secretly transferring them to Kurdish-controlled prisons. It's a practice some in the community call political kidnapping. According to a story in today's Washington Post, some of these abductions have been carried out with the knowledge of US forces and at times, with US participation. A confidential State Department cable obtained by The Washington Post calls these extrajudicial detentions. The cable says they're part of an effort by Kurdish political parties to exercise authority in Kirkuk in an increasingly provocative manner. Anthony Shadid wrote the story along with his colleague Steve Fainaru. And, Anthony Shadid, who are these men who are being detained?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now you're referring to these as abductions. Why are they not arrests, simple detentions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's talk about this question of alleged US involvement in these raids and seizures. That seems to be under some dispute. What did people there tell you about that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You did talk to several people there, including at least one US military officer who told you that the prisoners were being transferred to Kurdish jails to ease crowding in Kirkuk jails. Does that make sense?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In Argentina, the amnesty is over. For more than two decades, hundreds of the military and police personnel who committed crimes in the country's so-called Dirty War have been protected from prosecution. They were shielded by two amnesty laws. Now the Supreme Court of Argentina has thrown out those laws, and that opens the way to new cases being brought for crimes dating back to the 1970s, when thousands of Argentines were killed. Kevin Gray is senior correspondent for the Reuters news agency in Buenos Aires, and he joins us. How many people might conceivably be charged now for what they did in the Dirty War?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do prosecutors presumably have enough information about the thousands who are, in the idiom of the day, `disappeared' or killed in order to bring cases and make convictions?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do the politics of the military junta from 1976--do such politics still have adherents in Argentina today, and is there any concern that indeed there could be another coup over this very matter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Kevin Gray is senior correspondent for Reuters in Buenos Aires. A State Department spokesman was at pains today to state that the US government--State, Defense, everyone--is of one mind when it comes to Uzbekistan. Here's the reason he was peppered with questions about the Central Asian, formally Soviet republic. Uzbek authorities massacred hundreds of protesters last month. It's the sort of thing that can earn a country condemnation from Washington, even a cutoff of aid. On the other hand, Uzbekistan helps the US and NATO in Afghanistan. The Washington Post reports today that while Secretary of State Rice was calling for an international investigation of the Uzbek massacre at Andijan, the Department of Defense was effectively siding with Russia against one, hence all the denials. Glenn Kessler is one of The Washington Post reporters who wrote today's story. Which is it? Does Washington speak with a united voice in favor of an international probe of what the Uzbeks did, or are there some differences or nuances at work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do the Uzbeks make of all the calls for an international independent investigation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, that precious piece of property, the air base which, as you say, is used for--in support of what's going on in Afghanistan, is something that the US and in broader terms, to some extent, NATO gets from Uzbekistan. What does Uzbekistan get from the US?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think is going to happen? Do you think the United States is really going to press for that international investigation that Secretary Rice has already called for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, from what you found in your reporting for this article, is there, in the US today, any understood standard for what US interrogators do regard as acceptable?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " To what degree do you regard this as a pragmatic matter? That is, if we knew that we could rely on, say, the application of electric shock to make anyone talk and to speak honestly and we faced conspiracies assembling dirty bombs to be placed in our cities, would you say given the size of the threat and the efficacy of the technique it's OK, or should there be absolute moral boundaries which say, `You can never do that to a person'?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Another technique that you mention in your article, waterboarding. What is it, and is it torture?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And, therefore, it's something that you could say safely would be out of bounds even if one might uncover some massive airplane plot by doing it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm. You interviewed a number of people who've been interrogators, Americans and others. First of all, how explicit about their techniques do they get when they talk to you, and how effective do they regard their various techniques?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What have they decided?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you tell me what are then the criteria that scientists use to determine extinction?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So it takes more to declare a tiny species extinct because it's harder to find them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " With all these formerly extinct species now reappearing, are you still confident in saying that some are definitely never coming back?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In your work, have you ever found a species that was thought to be extinct?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So why this decision?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really? What happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So people weren't chatting?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Did all the Wi-Fi-using customers affect sales?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...is that right? And you're there. Tell me what's the atmosphere like right now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So a big mistake?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do consumers thing about that when they go buy their next car? How much does it matter to them and do they notice it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would there then be a cost to the company's bottom line from a mistake like this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, these companies are big marketing heads, presumably don't talk a lot with the big CEOs, but is there some way to keep this from happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. Did you have much warning that these plants were going to close?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " For example?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " As these plants were going under, your area actually had a big expansion with NASCAR. Are some of the people who lost their jobs in the plants the same ones who have gone into the NASCAR industry there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What other advice might you have for a community who could be facing large-scale layoffs quite soon?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's remarkable to you in this Census Bureau report, which tells us that the Hispanic population is now about 41.3 million people, or 14.1 percent of the population?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is that because the birth rates among Hispanic immigrants in the US are very high, or other Hispanics, or is it because immigration is slowing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And if we look at the other end of the scale, say over 65, again, a much smaller share of Hispanics?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do various metrics tell you about how successfully Hispanic immigrant populations are assimilating into American life?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The number of children, you said--if we look at youngsters in the country, the share that is Hispanic will be up above 20 percent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you're dependent on the technology here. This was developed by a San Francisco company, right?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " We read today in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about an unusual sign and the literally uphill fight to save it. In 1933, Boy Scouts in Murrysville, Pennsylvania--that's about 20 miles east of Pittsburgh--planted 850 trees on a hillside in a pattern that spelled M-U-R-R-Y-S-V-I-L-L-E. The Post-Gazette has a file photo of what it looked like. In 1947, it earned fame in \"Ripley's Believe It or Not,\" which reckoned that it was the world's largest arboreal sign. The Post-Gazette also has a current picture from roughly the same vantage point on Route 22, and what you see now is mostly a lot of trees. The ones that spell out Murrysville are much too high, and in what should be the empty spaces between them, there's a lot of extraneous growth making the letters even harder to discern. Well, Glenn Skena is one of a group of Murrysville citizens who are trying to figure out how to save the sign. Mr. Skena, what happened to those perfectly legible 11 letters that those trees used to spell out?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, when people move into Murrysville nowadays, is it evident to them that there's a sign there, or would you have to point it out to them, to say, `Those used to be trees that spelt out Murrysville'?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When would you say was the heyday of the Murrysville sign?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What about today's Boy Scouts?"}

Miami Herald reporter Pablo Bachelet will be covering the event and joins us now. Mr. Bachelet, you spoke with Ms. Rice ahead of this gathering, and she talked about `promoting mechanisms to protect democracies.' Can you tell us what she means by this?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And so what does that mean for Mr. Goss?"}

NEUBAUM: Well, I probably would have been in here waiting for the link maybe to come up, and hopefully it would.

NEUBAUM: A great deal, more than I can go into right now. It's kind of like--and then maybe it's this way for her, too--I'm able to put this milestone behind you and move on to the next one 'cause there's always a next one, you know, the next goal, and I plan to be back for her next one, which I think is Keystone, Heather?"}

Imagine a baseball season when the New York Yankees are struggling in fourth place, the overall number of home runs is declining, and a major league team from Washington, DC, is a hit. Oh, that's right, that's this baseball season. Well, sportswriter Stefan Fatsis of The Wall Street Journal joins us, as he does most Fridays, for a glimpse of the season at the one-third mark. Stefan, let's start with the home run totals which are down around 25 percent from their peak in 2000. Now do we think that this has something to do with fewer players now taking performance-enhancing drugs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And there's a new team in this town, in Washington, DC, the Washington Nationals. And they're doing pretty well. They still don't have a new owner, though. What's going on with that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who's affected most by the current shortage of food?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Richard, some have said that the food crisis is on the scale of the mid-1990s, at a point where millions of North Koreans starved to death. At this point, are you starting to see evidence of illness and starvation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Richard, I want to take you back to something that you mentioned earlier. The current crisis is due, in part, to the really very restrictive government policies there in North Korea. When you move about the country and actually talk to people, what do they have to say about this? Do they point a finger at the government?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, Arthur Andersen, the firm and its role in destroying Enron-related documents--was this seen as an isolated case or did the investigation and the eventual conviction have an immediate impact on the industry?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There was a long of hand-wringing within the industry while this legislation was under discussion on the Hill. What's happened now, since the law's gone into effect?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Has there been a question about enforcement? You know, who's actually doing the oversight now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You know, changes like this that we're talking about in the industry--does this largely impact the corporate world, or does this in some ways touch the lives of ordinary Americans, folks like you and me? And if it does, how so?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Let's turn to the security operation that we mentioned in Baghdad itself, no clear sign of the 40,000 Iraqi troops that were supposed to be helping with that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There was also the arrest today of a well-known Sunni political leader who was arrested, taken from his home by US forces. The Iraqi government's said to be very upset about that. What can you tell us about what happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would the mistake have been the result, then, of misinformation, disinformation, some party with something to gain by his arrest?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Jennifer Ludden. French voters today roundly rejected the European Union's first constitution. The vote is a blow both to the EU and to French President Jacques Chirac, who'd lobbied hard for a yes vote. The constitution is aimed at strengthening European unity and streamlining EU bureaucracy. But each of the union's 25 members must approve for it to take effect. The Netherlands is set to vote on the constitution later this week. Reporter Eleanor Beardsley joins me now from Paris. Eleanor, how did this vote break down? ELEANOR BEARDSLEY reporting: Well, it was a huge turnout. Seventy percent of people--the eligible voters showed up, and about 55 percent voted for this constitution. So as Chirac himself said, it's a massive and democrat defeat of the European Constitution. And you seem to be surrounded by people, though, who are celebrating the no vote. Is that right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You were out speaking with voters earlier throughout the day. Can you give us a sense of what reasons people said they were voting no?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " President Chirac very much wanted a yes vote. What does this rejection mean for him?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what happens now with the EU Constitution?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How was the secretary-general greeted in the refugee camp?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now in addition to what's been happening in the western Darfur region, I understand that you are seeing troubles in the eastern part of Sudan. What's happening?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You traveled as a fellow with the US Institute of Peace, and your goal was to assess Iraq's new leadership. Let me ask you first, what do you make of the new leaders there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how are they handling it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We're always gauging the violence there, basically asking is it civil war yet. How did you find relations between the Shia and the Sunni and the Kurds?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You got out to the south to Basra, which is the biggest Shiite city in the south of Iraq. How are things there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Darwin never knew there was such a thing as a gene. So when he spoke of evolution by natural selection, what did he mean?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Today, we know so much more about why different species are varied and different. We've mapped the human genome, as well as that of other species. Has the information that's come out in this past century and a half, has it re-enforced Darwin?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So take us back to science class for a minute. What happens in a cell when there's a mutation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do they change? What determines if this pattern changes?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I mean, from a survival of the fittest perspective, what's happening with that cone snail as its toxins mutate?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you give me a sense of the time involved? I mean, over what kind of time can scientists observe mutations?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you talking minutes, weeks, years?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You say some mutations can happen in milliseconds. But what kind of a time frame would there be, for example, for, you know, a species to evolve into another species?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So are you saying that modern science has discovered even perhaps greater links between humans and animals, if not plants, than Darwin imagined?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how the American women doing in the French Open?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And why was this neighborhood the focus of this operation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How would you describe the division of labor in this operation between the Iraqi forces and the US forces who are working alongside them?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Iraqi forces here are largely Shia; the population in this neighborhood is largely Sunni. Did that lead to any tensions? Did you talk to anybody in the neighborhood to see how they were responding?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Today's news from Baghdad includes a report of a car bomb at a restaurant, a drive-by murder of a top national security official and his driver, which was carried out by two car loads of gunmen. When will such attacks subside, and when will Baghdad be a city of peace?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...simply get in a car and drive to Baghdad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What is your definition of sooner rather than later?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A welcome sign. What is the link between that development and the insurgency? Do you think that it will actually diminish the insurgency, or is the insurgency all about, as you first mentioned, foreign fighters or former regime elements who aren't going to join in the process?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are you talking, though, about a sociopolitical dynamic, or do you mean that if the Sunni leaders are helping you find the people who are doing these things in their communities, that will help root out the insurgency?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I've been asking you questions about security and legitimacy of the government. You're the minister of Planning. Is anything getting planned nowadays in Baghdad?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are things being developed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is a new country being built?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You are doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you went out and you hunted bail jumpers or fugitives, or what were you doing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's the moment when you are involved in a production of singing--what's the moment of the peak gratification for you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder suffered a resounding defeat today in local elections in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine Westphalia, Schroeder's Social Democratic Party was voted out in favor of the conservative Christian Democrats. The blow could affect Schroeder's chances for a third term. After the results came in, he called for early national elections. NPR's Emily Harris is in Dusseldorf, the capital of North Rhine Westphalia and joins us. Hi, Emily. EMILY HARRIS reporting: Hi, Jennifer. How big a defeat was this for Schroeder?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do the Christian Democrats get an outright win, or are they going to have to find a coalition?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What were the issues in the vote?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When these results came in, Chancellor Schroeder called for early elections. They're due next year, but now he says he'll ask for them possibly as early as this fall. What do you think he's thinking?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Tell me, what is the normal procedure for choosing children to take part in the clinical drug trial, and what protections are there when children are used?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who decides that the child is going to take part? Are their parents consulted?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if there's a foster child, do the foster parents play the role of the parent? Can they give permission?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How old does a child have to be to give consent?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What if the child says, `No, I don't want that shot. I don't want the pill'?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And is this done nationally? Are there national rules for this, or is it up to individual states? And are the rules the same?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The story we just heard about involves some clinical trials of children with AIDS back in the '80s and '90s. Have the guidelines covering children in clinical trials changed since then?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How do you read what Congress is investigating now? I mean, on the one hand, it sounds like these children were essentially guinea pigs. On the other hand, you know, you could say that the states were trying to do the right thing and provide these foster children with the best treatment at the time that was available. How do you look at what happened?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Would you explain to me, how did you carry this out? How'd you get beyond what people think they do and calculate what they actually do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But why do they think they do even more than they actually do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Don't you wonder, though, if the people that you studied kind of cheated once they had those watches on their wrists? I mean, weren't the men more likely to just run and get that laundry than they normally would do?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the Baltimore Sun on Friday had a big front-page spread saying a--tough odds for Pimlico. You believe that?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, the Preakness is the big day for Pimlico, the racetrack. What does Pimlico mean for the city of Baltimore?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You said that the horse racing industry isn't what it used to be. I mean, is part of the problem here that it's just not financially viable anymore?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " Suzanne, we noted that Marion True has denied the charges. Has she issued a statement? And how has the Getty responded to this?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " That's the space where you had your studio?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One thing I was curious about was, if you look over the last four or five years, say, do you see a progression? Is there a steady course of the disease, do you think? Or has it kind of jumped around?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's changed?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You don't see that, Tom?"}

{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do you actually have to stand up and declare, `I am about to filibuster,' or does it just happen by default, that you start talking and you don't stop?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now, in this case, Republicans want to end the filibuster for judicial nominees. How are they going to go about doing that procedurally?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And has that been done before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There's been a lot of invoking of the Constitution in this whole debate and what the Constitution has to say about the right of the minority in the Senate. What does the Constitution say about all of this? Is any of it written down there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Hmm. This whole story raises real questions about the accuracy of the undersea charts. How is it that the chart that this submarine was relying on didn't show this mountain at all?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " One of the crew that you talked to was the commander of the vessel, and he acknowledged responsibility to you. You also talked to the father of the crewman who was killed, Daniel Ashley, and he seems to be blaming the Navy itself. Can you explain what he's thinking?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " In light of what happened here, has the Navy changed policies in any way?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what were some of the things that Justice Owen cited about what minors would need to do to convince the court?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " There are a number of other rulings that Justice Owen's opponents are calling anti-consumer in her time on the Texas state Supreme Court; rulings that seem to favor corporations over individuals, her opponents say. What are some of those rulings? How has she come down?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you talk to people in Texas, maybe lawyers who've argued before her, fellow judges, what do they say about Priscilla Owen, her judicial temperament?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Where do you begin when you're looking at this vacant space? And we know there are many organizations wishing to build there. Do you begin by developing the infrastructure first? What would be your architectural recommendation?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what will the design look like? Before, they were concrete and side by side. Will they be less dense now? Will they be peaked-roof, one-story, two-story? How will they look?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, and this has been a controversy with this administration going back to the last tenure of the president in the White House. How is the president's council getting around the problem of the need to destroy the embryos in order to work with them now?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, personally, Joe, I'm happy to give one of my own cells if it'll help scientific research. But what about everybody else? The suggestions--do any of them resolve all of this?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, despite these reservations, Joe, research on stem cells is definitely moving forward. California voters approved spending $3 billion over the next decade on stem-cell research. New Jersey is also looking at ways to fund this research. Is any of this goading the president's council to move forward?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what happened when you tried to crack down on leaving these sorts of things?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The number that this United Nations reports released a couple of days ago publishes in terms of Iraqi civilians killed is 24,000. Other organizations have put that number far higher. This is people killed as a direct result of the invasion. Is your government keeping track of these numbers?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " When you return to Baghdad, how do you deal with your own security? Members of your government, people of your caliber, colleagues when you were in the previous government, you know, have all been killed despite being attended by security convoys. I mean, how do you think about your own personal safety?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I just want to draw your attention to something that caught our eye this morning in the front page of The New York Times. It's a small report about a television series, a television soap opera, created with some money out Dubai inside Iraq, that currently has everyone hooked about young lovers. It's been going on for over a year and they start on the Jadbria Bridge(ph) falling in love and, `Oh, will our love survive the war,' and they do persist and they do get married and then they're tragically blown up in a car bomb on the way to their honeymoon. Is that a sort of sense of--you know, the program is known for having black humor, but is that a kind of commentary on life in Iraq today?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What sparked this violence?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now the president of Uzbekistan, Islom Karimov, spoke out about this violence yesterday. He didn't say a great deal, but he did blame it on Islamic extremists. Are these really extremists?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what about the government? I mean, how secure is the government of President Islom Karimov?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think the Uzbeks are sort of taking a look at what's going on elsewhere?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What happens if the Karimov government should collapse?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So how long did the FBI have this sting operation going on?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How'd they break the case? Did they get one person to inform on others?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Of course, all the nation's borders have been under scrutiny ever since 9/11, but this border particularly has been the subject of a lot of attention by federal officials, hasn't it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Is there a fear, Ralph, that on the other side of the border in Mexico and Central America that drug kingpins have a lot of money to throw at border agents?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what happens now? The defendants have entered pleas. Are they cooperating with authorities?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And you come from a famous musical family in Brazil, the daughter of Walter Santos and Tereza Souza, both composers and musicians. So you probably could have just stayed in Brazil and used your family's name to help build a career, but you have chosen to come here to the United States. Why?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And there's also a composition on this new album that was written by your parents in 1960 and never recorded. Why didn't they?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You don't usually write your own lyrics, but you do seem to have a real interest and affinity for words. You've set the poems of Pablo Neruda and Elizabeth Bishop, the poet, to music. Where do you get that sort of passion for the words?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So were you like 10 years old when you first sang this song?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And to hear more of Luciana Souza's music, go to our Web site, npr.org. And that's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Jacki Lyden. For more on the Pentagon's list, we turn to three places that have a lot on the line. First to Connecticut, the state that would suffer the biggest loss in terms of jobs. More than 7,000 would be lost with the closure of the US Naval submarine base in Groton. Democrat Joseph Lieberman represents Connecticut in the United States Senate, and he joins us now. Senator Lieberman, what's your reaction to this news?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Groton has been targeted for shutdown in the past. You say you're ready to fight. Do you have enough ammunition for that fight?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. Now to South Dakota, the home of Ellsworth Air Force Base, which has half of the nation's fleet of B-1 bombers and is on the Pentagon's proposed closure list. Ellsworth is also the second-largest employer in the state of South Dakota. Jim Shaw is the mayor of Rapid City and joins us now. And, Mayor Shaw, what would the proposed closure of Ellsworth do to your city and your state?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " On the other hand, this is an Air Force base that was once connected to all the missile silos in South Dakota. It's post-Cold War now. Why not close the base?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Then why not be optimistic about life after Ellsworth closing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And how might that happen?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think the state was spared?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A long process that's not yet over. As we've said, this is a recommended list of base closing. As the horse trading continues, is it possible or are there any worries that an Oklahoma facility might still land on that list?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Colonel Chase, when you say that the insurgents seem to have gone to ground, this is a border area. Do you assume that they are still on the Iraqi side of the border, or might some of these insurgents have slipped across the border into Syria?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you find that among those who have been detained or those who have been killed--and earlier, we'd heard somewhere between 75 or a hundred insurgents killed--do you get the impression that a great many of them are, in fact, not Iraqis, but foreigners?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If this offensive works, if it's a success, how would that have any effect on the car bombings that we hear about daily in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Can you secure the gains that you make in this offensive without keeping a regiment of Marines there, or do you have the Iraqi forces that can step in and take over from you to at least make sure that there isn't a return to the situation, to the status quo ante?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now can you just describe a bit for us, when you are striking, when the Marines are striking, are they striking, at any time over the past days, a relatively large formation of insurgents, or is it typically a group of two or three or an individual sniper?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And casualties on the US side?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Mm-hmm. And the disadvantaged Democrats?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So who's left in the middle?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Which groups have grown much over time, and which have diminished?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The New York Times quotes an e-mail from you accusing Mr. Bolton essentially of having fostered a climate of politicization and intimidation in intelligence analysis. What exactly did he do?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, to what degree do you hold him accountable for that in this past administration?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " By the Syria testimony, we're talking about 2003, I guess, when Mr. Bolton was preparing his testimony for the House International Relations Committee about Syria and unconventional weapons programs, as the US understood them to be in Syria. What did the US hold to be the case, and what was he about to say was the case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, supporters of the Bolton nomination say this describes a process that should be taking place, push back here and there and out comes a result. Did you find something untoward about that exchange over Syria?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How often did that happen in the course of your two years on the National Intelligence Council that you had to tell the staff to play hardball?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Typically how different might the adjectives be or the verbs be in such a statement to provoke the kind of disagreement you're describing?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " The Silberman-Robb commission--that is, President Bush's commission that looked into the intelligence agencies--looked at what happened with discussions of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and concluded that they found, in that case at least, no evidence of political pressure to influence the intelligence community. Broadly speaking, are they being naive about what's been happening with policy-makers and the intelligence agencies?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, do we know what they talked about?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what's on the program for tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, how important is this anniversary, the 60 years since the end of the war, to Russian people?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " ...got this big celebration with all the world leaders?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Why do you think Vladimir Putin did invite all these leaders? What was his intent? And do you think it's going to work?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Because they were less likely to work. I mean, is the fact that there are more working mothers now also part of what's driving these fathers' groups?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what sorts of changes are these fathers' groups pushing for?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " These fathers' groups have had a bit of success in Iowa and Maine. Can you tell me what's happening there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's been the outcome of some of those class-action suits?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are those high-profile tactics likely to cross the ocean and be used here?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jim, let's start with you because that's where this story does begin. It's in 1990. You got a permit to set up a wolf observation camp in the Sawtooth Mountains there in Idaho, where you--and then later Jamie came to live with you. You were there until 1996. Why did you first want to study wolf behavior?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " He was writing you letters telling you what he was doing. What did you think?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Now these wolves were in an enclosed space, a very large one, but it was closed off. You brought them meat. And given that they were provided for in that way, how honest do you think your observations of their life were?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What do you think the effect of your project is, if any, on the wolf population?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How significant do you think having a completed Cabinet will be, assuming that this is approved in the assembly?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So you'd see a direct link between people the Sunni community trusts in the Cabinet and the number of suicide attacks we see?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what do we know then about who these insurgents are and how many there are?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " This ongoing insurgency is a strain for the US military. Do you think the US needs to send more troops to Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You keep in touch with military people here. You said you've spoken with people just back from Iraq. How do you find morale?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " First, tell me about America magazine and what about it could have led to Father Reese running afoul with the Vatican?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " So what kind of coverage did the Catholic Church to the America magazine have?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, Father Reese did not say why he was leaving. Do we know that he was fired?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what would the role of Pope Benedict be at all in this matter?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " I understand these rules are somewhat complicated. Can you lay out the basics for us?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " How many horse names are registered with your club?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have people tried to sneak by some naughty names before?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What's your favorite name?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Jay Bryant is a political consultant. He lives in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. On Saturday, Donald Herbert suddenly became lucid. The Buffalo, New York, firefighter had not spoken in almost 10 years. In 1995, he was trapped under a collapsed roof. He went without oxygen for several minutes and suffered brain damage. He woke up for a while in 1996, but otherwise, ever since the accident, he was unresponsive, uncommunicative, until Saturday. He asked for his wife. He talked with his family. He spoke sensibly, his doctors said. He counted to 200. Well, since that surprising development, his family says there have been some bursts of conversation but nothing nearly so dramatic as his breakthrough on Saturday. Mr. Herbert's doctors say they changed his medication three months ago; they won't say what the new medication is. Dr. James Burnat is a professor of neurology at Dartmouth Medical School, and he joins us from Hanover, New Hampshire. Dr. Burnat, how rare is a recovery of the sort we've heard described from brain damage of this sort that we've heard described?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. Jamil Ahmed, the rehabilitative specialist who's been treating Mr. Herbert, said in response to a reporter's question at that news conference that Mr. Herbert was `close to a persistent vegetative state.' Now does that sound right to you?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " You talked with us several weeks ago during the time that the whole country was focused on the fate of Terri Schiavo, who was in a persistent vegetative state. I guess the question on many people's minds around the country is: Was somebody in her condition capable, conceivably, of such a surprising recovery as Mr. Herbert has experienced?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Do you think of lucidity, in the case of a patient like this one, as a plateau that one can leap up onto and generally stay there, or is it sort of something that one must constantly try to grab ahold of and might just as easily slip down from?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " During yesterday's news conference, Dr. Ahmed, the rehabilitative specialist, suggested that there might be many patients in nursing homes who haven't been given similar medication but might become remarkably more responsive if they were treated. Does that strike you as right?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Dr. James Burnat spoke to us from Hanover, New Hampshire. He is a professor of neurology at Dartmouth Medical School. The Iraqi insurgents have organized many suicide bombings over the past year. How they do that is a question we're going to put now to Bruce Hoffman, who studies terrorism at the RAND Corporation And, Bruce Hoffman, perhaps I've begged the question by saying the insurgents have organized all the suicide bombings. How organized a campaign is it?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Who are these recruits?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " What does it say then about the larger insurgency in Iraq that these are the people who seem to be doing the most damage?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Have the suicide bombings in Iraq generated the kind of trading card subculture that one can find, say, in Gaza, where in addition to cards there are posters all over the wall commemorating the martyrs who died in the cause?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Since that time, there's still been a lot of suicide terrorism. Does that suggest that whatever the fight here is they are winning?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " But if there were adequate vigilance, if there were an adequate effort to counter this form of terrorism, wouldn't there be some general buzz of news to the effect of, `A would-be suicide bomber was arrested somewhere in Iraq yesterday,' or `A bomb factory was discovered and a number of vests were found.' And we're not hearing that sort of thing, are we?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " We've seen this consistent upward march in short-term interest rates over the past year or so, but a very different pattern with mortgage rates. How would you describe the pattern there?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Well, what are some possibilities? What are mortgage rates responding to?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " If you look at patterns in the past, when short-term rates have been high, have mortgage rates also been high?"}

You can see a comparison of short-term interest rates and mortgage rates, and read today's statement from the Federal Reserve, at npr.org. The kidnapping of an Australian engineer in Iraq reminds us that in addition to the troops serving there, there are thousands of civilian contractors, and there are dangers to doing such work. T. Christian Miller writes for the Los Angeles Times and covers the reconstruction of Iraq. He joins us in the studio in Washington. Welcome to the program. Mr. T.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " $5,000 a day?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " A year ago we were hearing a lot more about the dangers to American contractors in Iraq.

{"prompt": "", "completion": " You wrote a story about a California company, Parsons; that's a contractor for Iraqi reconstruction. It makes sense for them to be doing this? This is a good business deal for them in Iraq?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And who won out in that case?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Are the contractors able to hire? Can they fill all the--I was looking at the KBR Web site today, the Halliburton subsidiary, and they appear to have, at least as of the last time they freshened the Web site, I think it's 580-something openings for everything from this kind of technician to bus driver to truck driver to plumber. Are they having trouble filling those jobs?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And do you have any idea who's going to be showing up on Saturday?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " Like what?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": " And what do you serve at a time traveler convention?"}
