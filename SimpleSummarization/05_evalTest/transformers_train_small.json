{"prompt": " Good morning, Lulu.", "completion": " All right. What's the latest?"}
{"prompt": " No. This is kind of like a trail of bread crumbs. Each revelation leads to something else. Some of them are pretty dramatic, like those text messages, where we learned that it wasn't just Rudy Giuliani freelancing in this Ukraine pressure campaign. It was U.S. diplomats actively pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden and the 2016 election on behalf of the president. And we have this cast of characters - Kurt Volker, special envoy to Ukraine, who disclosed the text messages. We have William Taylor, who we haven't heard from yet, but he was the career diplomat brought in to replace Yovanovitch. He was uncomfortable about with the whole arrangement. And then Gordon Sondland, who's this millionaire donor to Trump and ambassador to the EU who was very intent on getting what he called the deliverable that the president wanted, which was a Ukrainian investigation of Biden, in exchange for what Ukraine wanted, which was military aid to help them defend themselves against the Russians and a White House meeting to show that they had U.S. backing.", "completion": " What his happening to his support among Republican lawmakers, Mara? I mean, has anything changed?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning.", "completion": " How would this work? I mean, if you're a visitor and you're traveling, you would obviously get travel insurance, which isn't terribly expensive. If you are coming to immigrate, then what would you have to show?"}
{"prompt": " It sounds, frankly, more like the intention is for the optics of the policy as much as it is, you know, having a practical system in place to do it. If you read the document that was announced, you find that it actually outlines many of the other things that the Trump administration has either proposed or is in the process of trying to pursue. So they've presented it in their own document as part of what advocates for immigrants refer to as the invisible wall.", "completion": " Your state, Texas, has one of the highest number of uninsured people in the U.S. So are the people who are uninsured Americans, or is the bigger portion people who are immigrants?"}
{"prompt": " We have a set of circumstances where increasingly, in basketball, most certainly, and in football, it is the black athlete that is the backbone of the whole process of producing this tremendous wealth. You look at the NFL, you look at the quarterbacks in the top 25 collegiate programs, and increasingly, they are black. That means that what we're looking at here is not just a situation of financial exploitation but of racial domination where you have white - overwhelmingly white coaches, athletic departments, college presidents and chancellors profiting off of the uncompensated labor of black players in football and basketball.", "completion": " The NCAA is saying this is an affront to amateurism. What's your response to that?"}
{"prompt": " Well, the inequality is already there. You have coaches in the SCC who make more than the football budget for some other Division I institutions in the same state. The other point is that the money that the athletes would get through being able to capitalize on their own names, images and so forth comes from sponsors. It comes from people that they would represent in terms of a particular product. This is not money that's coming out of the pocket of the school or out of the pockets of the NCAA.", "completion": " The NCAA is expected to release a report later this month with recommendations on how to manage these new privileges. What do you hope to see in that report?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning.", "completion": " I'd like first to get your response to the Trump administration's refusal to share that whistleblower's complaint with Congress. What do you think about that?"}
{"prompt": " Well, first of all, it's illegal. We have a very straightforward law that requires them to share that complaint if the inspector general of the intelligence community deems it to be urgent and credible, which, in this case, he has. And you know, it's a very, very important law because it's one of the few safeguards we have against a president misusing the intelligence community. You know, if the president were to order the CIA to spy on a political opponent or to commit some other crime, this is one of the few safeguards we have.", "completion": " Now, we should explain that this has to do, according to some reports, with President Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine when he allegedly pressured the Ukrainians to investigate Joe Biden's son. It's a claim that Trump calls a ridiculous story. But at the same time, he has also said, someone ought to look into Joe Biden. And of course, Joe Biden is his potential opponent in the 2020 election - all of this, as we've heard, bringing renewed calls from many Democrats for impeachment proceedings. Where do you stand on that?"}
{"prompt": " And yes, impeachable.", "completion": " You say, if it's true, what powers does the House have to try to corroborate this claim?"}
{"prompt": " It does have to be corroborated. We can't impeach a president based on, you know, unnamed people speaking to the press, as credible and numerous as these reports may be. So you know, there is an investigation underway already by three House committees into what President Trump may have done with Ukraine. That is going to absolutely heat up in the next couple of weeks. So all I can say is, stay tuned. Fasten your seatbelts. The stakes here are extremely high.", "completion": " Let me ask you, congressman. There are a number of Democrats and voters who are saying, you know, where is the party's spine in all of this? This is a president who has been, they say, running roughshod over your legislative authority with total impunity. What do you say to that?"}
{"prompt": " That is not American democracy.", "completion": " Very briefly, congressman, are you hearing anything from Republicans in Congress on all of this, or are you hearing total silence?"}
{"prompt": " Thanks so much, Melissa. I am happy to be here.", "completion": " The original vote by the county commission was to remove that Confederate obelisk, but ultimately, that ran up against a state law in Georgia. What does that state law say?"}
{"prompt": " Well, let me say this. And you know, being on the BOC, you see all kinds of emails. And there were people in social media that said, I will receive the monument, and I will be happy to display it. But ultimately, I personally, as a commissioner - I'm satisfied with the outcome. I believe that the contextualization gives a balanced view of history. I can say, personally, even within my district, I've had very spirited conversations with individuals on both sides of the aisle who feel that it is a good thing to have the monument erected and contextualize it. And there are some who said it is a very painful reminder of a dark time in history, and I don't want to see it at all.", "completion": " I'm curious - for you as an African American, is part of it painful when you see that obelisk and know who - for whom it was erected and in their praise?"}
{"prompt": " I will say, for me, as an African American, it is a constant reminder of a period. For me, being raised in rural Alabama - I often call it LA to sort of poke light at where I'm from, but I absolutely love lower Alabama. You know, for me - and coming from a family of civil activists and people that were truly on the front line of the civil rights movement - it is a constant reminder. But I don't see that personally - from a personal perspective as a bad thing. I think across races, all hues, it is very important that we understand our history and embrace it and appreciate it.", "completion": " I was looking at a statement from your fellow Commissioner Mereda Davis Johnson, who voted for the plaque but was not happy about what the outcome was. She called it progress, not victory. And here's what she said - shame on the Georgia Legislature for forcing local governments to leave in place racist symbols. Do you agree with her that the law in Georgia should be changed so that you could remove the obelisk - the monument - and not have to put it somewhere else?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning, Lulu.", "completion": " What details do we know about these attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities?"}
{"prompt": " It could. You know, Saudi Arabia is a giant oil exporter. Up until just recently, it was the world's largest oil exporter. But the attacks on these two installations will mean the loss of about 5% of the global oil supply, which could increase the price of oil globally. But you know, Lulu, these attacks happen as the kingdom is looking to sell off a slice of Saudi Aramco in an initial public offering, which could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars for the kingdom. And certainly, security of the oil supplies and management of the company are critical to any potential investors. And so to have this sort of brazen strike on these oil installations is going to be a challenge for Saudi Aramco and the Saudi government.", "completion": " Iran, of course, is allied with the Houthi rebels who claimed responsibility for the attack. The Houthi rebels themselves say that Iran is not behind these attacks. What proof is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offering?"}
{"prompt": " Well, what happened was that some of his former allies turned against him. First of all, his former military chief of staff Benny Gantz joined the race, and he became Netanyahu's main opponent. Then what happened was that Netanyahu won the elections, but then another former ally of his turned against him - Avigdor Lieberman. He's a right-wing politician, and he refused to join Netanyahu's coalition. So Netanyahu was left without a majority. And what he did was something that hasn't been done before in Israel - he pushed for new elections.", "completion": " But do they have an actual chance of beating him and becoming prime minister?"}
{"prompt": " Well, if anyone can replace Netanyahu, it would be Benny Gantz. He right now is neck and neck with Netanyahu in the race. He's this tall, good-looking, popular figure. He's a centrist. He's trying to run as a unifying figure for the country as an alternative to Netanyahu's divisive style. But he honestly doesn't really have a clear path to forming a government and even says he's willing to ally with Netanyahu's party. There's this other politician I mentioned, Avigdor Lieberman. He's been gaining in popularity because he has tapped into public resentment against Netanyahu's alliances with religious parties. He will not be prime minister, but he will get enough votes, probably, to tip the scales and determine who will. So we have to see whether this time around he'll be willing to help Netanyahu keep his seat. The thing is that the polls show that we could see very similar results as the last election. And that could mean a stalemate and maybe even third elections.", "completion": " What kind of campaign is Bibi Netanyahu running to try and win a clear victory this time?"}
{"prompt": " Well, he's poking at those divisions that you mentioned. His tactic is to energize his working-class right-wing base to actually show up at the polls. And so he is warning of terror attacks if he's not elected. He's warning that Palestinian-Arab politicians will come to power if he's not elected. He's even promising to annex land in the West Bank, which would be a very controversial move. And he's also trying to play up his status as this world statesman. So he met Vladimir Putin last week. You go around Israel, and you see these big posters of Netanyahu posing with Putin and with Trump.", "completion": " President Trump is, of course, a close ally to Netanyahu. Is the president playing a role in the Israeli elections? Is he trying to help Netanyahu win?"}
{"prompt": " Yes.", "completion": " But to explore what it was like to be gay under the Uruguayan dictatorship, which lasted from 1973 to 1985, is an interesting lens to view it through. Why did you want to set it in this period?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning, Lulu.", "completion": " How is it that a local election has become such a test for Vladimir Putin's regime?"}
{"prompt": " Well, you have to remember that Russia is a super centralized country. In an American context, Moscow plays the role of New York, Washington and Los Angeles combined. And so what happens here really determines the way that the whole country goes. Of course, the Moscow City Council has practically no real power, but the Kremlin couldn't face the idea of outright critics of Putin winning elected office. It would've given them a bully pulpit to talk to the whole country. And more importantly, I think it would've given the opposition legitimacy and sort of set a precedent for other regions in Russia.", "completion": " With Putin's opponents barred from the election, though, aren't the results a foregone conclusion?"}
{"prompt": " Well, I think it's interesting that despite the Kremlin's tight control over the political system here, elections do matter. In the past, there have been lots of documented instances of vote-rigging. But the government also understands that if there are mass violations in a city like Moscow, that could spark even more protests. Putin, on the whole, is still very popular, but the ruling party, which is called United Russia, is absolutely not. In fact, Putin has abandoned the party. So has the Moscow mayor. And now all of the candidates for United Russia and Moscow are hiding their party affiliation and running as independents. What makes the Kremlin especially nervous is that you have opposition leader Alexei Navalny telling his supporters not to boycott the election, but instead to go out and use their ballots to vote against those pro-government candidates.", "completion": " Looking ahead, once these elections are done, what is the opposition's strategy if they don't have an event to rally around?"}
{"prompt": " No. I mean, almost all of them uniformly - all of the women whose stories that I followed - girls, some of them, because they got their - they were married before they were even 16, some of them. They very often became victims of the order that they thought was going to bring them some kind of empowerment. They - if their husbands were fighters, they usually died after a few months, and they were expected to remarry again and again. And when they said no, they were punished. You know, even worse, if women tried to escape, they had their children taken away from them.", "completion": " The role of women in ISIS has sort of been badly documented or ignored by journalists or fetishized on the other side. Why did you want to tell these stories?"}
{"prompt": " I think we're only coming into some kind of understanding of women and militancy - how women, at the same time, can be perpetrators and victims, you know? I think we have to arrive at a much more nuanced understanding. And I think, through these stories, we can see that women can organize. They can recruit people into these kind of militant groups. But because they're women, they can very quickly also suffer violence at the hands of such groups. And it's very tricky understanding, what is their culpability?", "completion": " Do you have an answer to that question? After hearing all these stories, some would say - even though you write with great empathy - should they not be judged by their actions?"}
{"prompt": " And that is the reality of, you know, the cost associated with these storms. It's the reality of climate change. I know your president doesn't believe in climate change. But I hope he'll change his position because, ultimately, it is countries here in the Caribbean that are really suffering the greater consequences from the effects of climate change.", "completion": " Yeah. At the time, you also said that rich countries should pay for the recovery because they are the ones emitting the greenhouse gases. Do you think the same should happen with the Bahamas?"}
{"prompt": " Well, absolutely. I mean, they should pay. They should compensate these countries in the Caribbean that have to deal with these ferocious storms that are literally damaging infrastructure, damaging people's private properties and literally undermining our development.", "completion": " Well, who did pay after Hurricane Irma in 2017? I mean, you did accept some help from China, which is a big greenhouse gas emitter. But I'm curious - did the U.S. not step up?"}
{"prompt": " Well, what the U.S. gave was so paltry that I don't think it was even regarded - and that's no exaggeration - whereas I can recall that the People's Republic of China made a contribution of $2 million U.S., Canada - $3 million Canadian, the European Union - 5 million euros. I do not recall that the U.S. made any significant contribution.", "completion": " Obviously, the Bahamas are at the very earliest stages of their recovery, but what advice do you have for them as they look to rebuild?"}
{"prompt": " Well, you know, the recovery is going to be difficult. I know the prime minister serving his government - they're going to come in for a lot of criticisms because, normally, your residents call upon you for immediate recovery, not take into consideration the costs and that the cost, generally speaking - they are prohibitive. For example, the funds that have been pledged by Canada, by the United Kingdom, by the European Union, we have not been able to avail (ph) ourselves of those funds as yet. And I'm quite sure the government of the Bahamas will find itself in a similar situation.", "completion": " So what has happened in Barbuda if you have not been able to get the money you need to rebuild, sir?"}
{"prompt": " Well, we have over 1,200 properties that were damaged. We have rebuilt about 600 of them. So as a result, we still have internally displaced persons. And that is just the reality of very scarce resources.", "completion": " Prime Minister, as you have mentioned, climate change predicts fiercer storms. Have you thought about what the future might look like in your country, which might make it uninhabitable?"}
{"prompt": " Right. President Trump first announced these tariffs about a month ago out of frustration with the slow pace of trade talks with China. And at first, he called for tariffs on virtually everything the U.S. buys from China. But after a couple of weeks, he backed down a little bit and announced that some of the tariffs would be postponed to avoid disrupting the holiday shopping season. So a lot of popular consumer items, like smartphones and laptops, some toys, are getting a reprieve - at least until December 15. At the same time, there are still a lot of products that are facing tariffs starting today - a lot of apparel, some food products, certain spices we import from China and, oddly enough, American flags. Last year, we bought more than $6 million worth of American flags made in China. As of today, they'll be taxed at 15%.", "completion": " So American flags are getting more expensive. So China said it was going to respond with tariffs of its own, but now it looks like Beijing may be hitting the pause button. Is the trade war heating up? Is it cooling off?"}
{"prompt": " That's what businesspeople and investors have been trying to figure out. And you know, reading the tea leaves, it seems to change day by day. Just over a week ago, China announced retaliatory tariffs on some $75 billion worth of American products, including automobiles. That really got under President Trump's skin. He pushed back by raising tariffs. The day that happened, the stock market nosedived. The S&P 500 fell more than 2.5%. But then, just a few days later, the president seemed to dial down the tensions. He told reporters that China had reached out and said it wanted to go back to the bargaining table. The stock market rallied. It's not actually clear that China had reached out. Maybe that was just a ruse from the president. But a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce did hint last Thursday that China might not go ahead with its own tariffs right now. Whatever's going on, the stock market seems to welcome this more conciliatory tone. This week, the S&P ended up about 2.7%.", "completion": " But the administration is still slapping new tariffs on China today. So what's going on?"}
{"prompt": " That's right. Even as he says he's open to talking with China, the president has left in place this latest round of tariffs, and the tariff rate is still 15%. That's up from 10% when the tax was initially announced. Trump is also threatening to raise the tariff rate on another $250 billion worth of Chinese imports that are already being taxed at 25%. Trump wants to raise that to 30% on October 1 unless there's some kind of deal between now and then. U.S. and Chinese negotiators are supposed to meet here in Washington sometime this month in September, but we haven't seen a real date yet.", "completion": " How is all this affecting businesses, consumers?"}
{"prompt": " Great to be with you, Leila.", "completion": " So this isn't the first time we've heard from negotiators that a deal is close. This war has been going on for two decades. What's different this time?"}
{"prompt": " Well, we know that the U.S. secretary of state had said he kind of wanted a deal to happen by today, September 1. We have presidential elections happening later this month, September 28. There have been nine rounds of talks, as you said. But now we have the U.S. negotiator and the Taliban both saying that this latest round was successful. He is saying they're on the threshold of a deal, and he's on his way here to Kabul to consult with the Afghan government.", "completion": " So last week, President Trump said that the U.S. is considering only a partial troop withdrawal. And this was a surprise to the Taliban, according to a spokesperson who spoke to NPR. The impending deal they thought hinged on a full withdrawal. Do we actually know what's in the deal?"}
{"prompt": " We're not sure. It hasn't been made public. What we understand is that there'll be a timeline for some sort of phased withdrawal of American forces in exchange for counterterrorism assurances from the Taliban. But really what's crucial is what's not in the deal. In March, there were four conditions - these counterterrorism, the U.S. withdrawal but also the inter-Afghan dialogue and a comprehensive cease-fire. Now then, Zalmay Khalilzad was saying there is no final agreement until everything is agreed. And now it seems as though he is saying that the inter-Afghan talks that will happen after this agreement is signed will basically spell out any sort of long-term peace and a long-term cease-fire. So we don't know how many specifics are in it and a lot of people here uneasy that they don't know what's - what exactly has been agreed.", "completion": " And then in the meantime, the Taliban is still launching attacks, and it seems like a tool for leverage. What will end the fighting?"}
{"prompt": " Well, that is a great question. And the real question here - and the son of the famed Northern Alliance commander Ahmad Shah Massoud this week is actually hedging his bets. He is bringing together on Wednesday an anti-Taliban coalition. They say they're going to fight the Taliban politically and militarily, if necessary - really kind of an indication that the Afghans aren't sure that they can trust the Taliban at all. Leila, while these negotiations have begun going on for nine months, the Taliban have continued to fight on the ground trying to increase their leverage on the battlefield so that they would have more influence at the negotiating table. And so Afghans aren't sure whether this - any peace agreement will mean the fighting is going to stop.", "completion": " So then what does that mean for Afghanistan's upcoming presidential elections scheduled for later this month?"}
{"prompt": " It's the first time we've described a new medicinal leech species from North America in 40 years. And it has a number of characteristics that make it as a new - considered a new species.", "completion": " What's up with the three jaws? Is this common?"}
{"prompt": " Most leeches in this group and other groups have three jaws, but the number of teeth in those jaws is more variable.", "completion": " So why three jaws? What do they need them for?"}
{"prompt": " Well, usually, I try to catch them before they actually bite. And also, you can see them swimming through the water, but sometimes it's inevitable.", "completion": " So what does the leech actually look like? How big is it?"}
{"prompt": " It varies in size - maybe an inch long. Some of the largest specimens can be between 6 and 8 inches long. But really, leeches stretch, so it's kind of hard to estimate.", "completion": " So this is the first new find of a medicinal leech in North America since 1975. What is a medicinal leech?"}
{"prompt": " ...And have anticoagulants that could be used in modern medicine. Leeches have these anticoagulants in their saliva. So when they bite, that causes the blood to flow and for the blood to stay liquid inside the leech once it's eaten it. And this has been used in medicine for many, many years. It was most popular in the 17, 1800s in Western medicine, and it's even used today in modern medicine. Leeches are approved medical device in the United States, and they're used readily.", "completion": " Tell me about your collection method. How did you find this three-jawed leech?"}
{"prompt": " Thank you so much for having me. I appreciate the opportunity.", "completion": " So the Log Cabin Republicans declined to endorse Trump's 2016 bid. What was the rationale for endorsing the reelection?"}
{"prompt": " Well, you know, it's not a very large board. I think that there is a sense that they wanted the opportunity to work within the party to be able to have a voice. Those of us who opposed it felt very, very strongly that the president simply has not earned the endorsement. That's why I and, at this point, several others have resigned from the board.", "completion": " Now, you made this decision very publicly, and I just wonder why was that important to you but also very specifically what were the major factors in you saying not only am I going to step down, I'm going to talk about why I did that?"}
{"prompt": " Sure. Listen, President Trump has an abysmal record on issues of equality and inclusion. And I think it's always important to stand up and to speak out when we're talking about such important issues to our country. I think it makes it easier for other people to stand up when they see somebody else doing it. And while I certainly respect that people have all sorts of reasons perhaps not to do so, from my perspective, the example that I want to set for my children and the reasons that I got involved in politics to begin with require that I make sure that my voice is heard.", "completion": " Since you resigned, one of the things I've heard from board members on the Log Cabin Republicans is, you know, actually they see the president as somebody who's been good on LGBTQ issues specifically and also that possibly what contributed to your resignation was that you worked on Bill Weld's campaign, who announced a primary challenge to Trump. How do you respond to that?"}
{"prompt": " Yeah, I'm just - obviously I saw the endorsement op-ed that the organization wrote, and it talks about the fact that this president, you know, supports the idea that homosexuality should be decriminalized throughout the world and that countries that criminalize it should be held accountable in some way. That's just - how low a bar are we going to set? This president has a record of targeting the transgender community over and over again, in housing protections, in protections for students, you know, the trans military ban, in so many ways.", "completion": " Now, you mentioned your children and how important they were in making this decision. In your resignation letter you wrote, you could never endorse Trump for president of the United States and still look them in the eye. What's your hope for the future of the Republican Party for your children?"}
{"prompt": " Good to be here.", "completion": " So first off, I just want a gut check from you - Wall Street ups and downs, that warning flare in the bond market, but we're also seeing strong consumer spending at the same time. What is your take on these mixed indicators?"}
{"prompt": " I think the story thus far has been there are warning signs out there. Consumers have been the strong point. Up until this week, however, there was a consumer sentiment number that it was at its lowest notching since, I want to say, six or seven months. So that does suggest that consumers may be wavering a little bit. I think the bigger picture, though, is the global risks essentially. So right now, we have something, like, nine major economies around the world either currently in recession or on the verge of recession, and you could imagine that there would be contagion effects.", "completion": " What will you be looking for tomorrow and in the near term beyond tomorrow?"}
{"prompt": " I will continue to be looking at the economic data as they come out, of course some of these leading indicators, including things like business-consumer sentiment, durable goods orders, other things that are not exactly household names. I'll also, of course, be looking at the messaging that we're getting out of this White House and how equipped they are to deal with these latent risks.", "completion": " Which actually brings me to my next question - how equipped do you think this administration is?"}
{"prompt": " That is what I'm very worried about. The real risk, as I see it right now, is that we will have a badly mismanaged recession because, right now, this administration has made pretty clear that it doesn't have a plan. It never had a plan. In fact, colleagues of mine from The Washington Post on the news side - I'm on the opinion side to clarify - reported earlier this week that administration officials have done no planning for any possible recession because they don't want to feed a negative narrative.", "completion": " Well, that brings me to this, which is that President Trump has been aggressive in using his position to juice the economy. I'm thinking of how he has been pressuring the Fed. That is unusual, needless to say. But is it a tactic that could work?"}
{"prompt": " This is also very, very troubling. His political pressure that he's putting on the Fed is largely unprecedented at least for the last several decades. Historically, going back to about the early '90s, the executive branch, the White House in particular, has made a concerted effort to never comment on monetary policy because you need the central bank to be independent both in practice and in perception in order for its actions to be credible. And if people start questioning whether the Fed is making choices about interest rates, that undermines their ability to make those decisions and for those decisions to have their intended effect.", "completion": " You keep on using this word credible, and it just reminds me that so much about the economy is based on people's perception, people's confidence in not only the leadership but where the leadership is taking us, right?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning, Lulu.", "completion": " What's the latest this morning, Jennifer?"}
{"prompt": " Well, at the scene of the attack, they are cleaning up. The walls and the floor are covered in blood. The tables and chairs have been pushed aside to get to those dead and wounded. We didn't even get a death toll until this morning. That attack happened on Saturday night at a crowded wedding hall, more than a thousand guests there. Right now, we have families burying their dead, including 14 members of one family alone, so a pretty devastating attack here in Kabul.", "completion": " And the Islamic State claimed that it carried out the attack, right?"}
{"prompt": " It did claim that it carried out the attack, and it named the bomber as well. This is a group that has targeted the minority Hazara, mainly Shia Hazara, community again and again, and this was another instance of that. It claimed that it sent the suicide bomber into the wedding hall.", "completion": " Obviously, this comes at a time when the United States is negotiating the withdrawal of U.S. troops. And first of all, where are we with these peace talks?"}
{"prompt": " Well, both the Taliban and the United States say things are moving forward. They just completed, on the 12 of August, the eighth round of talks in Doha and Qatar between the United States and the Taliban. On Friday, Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief U.S. negotiator, briefed President Trump on the talk and we understand he is heading back to the region. We understand that there is some sort of agreement hammered out, but we think it is just about withdrawal of U.S. troops and that a cease-fire has not been agreed, and that's a great concern here. The Afghan government has not been involved in these talks and the Afghan government spokesman, the presidential spokesman, yesterday said they want a cease-fire to be guaranteed in these talks and also a Taliban promise that they will negotiate with the government. But a lot of people here, Lulu, are very concerned about the lack of clarity on what's been happening at these peace talks and what it will mean for any kind of further violence here.", "completion": " Well, I mean, I suppose especially in the context of this latest bombing, I mean, will that have an effect on these talks briefly?"}
{"prompt": " Sure. So really Title IX was an educational amendment that is now several decades old from 1972. But in the past couple of decades, it has been interpreted and expanded a lot to also protect students, both male and female, from sexual violence, sexual harassment, stalking. Anything that could fall into the category of gender-based discrimination and sexual violence is something that Title IX is also sort of the umbrella federal law over.", "completion": " From what I've read, some of the men say that the reason that they want to undertake this kind of lawsuit is because when you have a judgment against you under Title IX, it can have ramifications for the rest of your life. Is that essentially what they're saying?"}
{"prompt": " I mean, that is one thing they're saying. And having represented a lot of survivors, I can't help but also think and say that it is a much more severe and horrific impact if you've been the victim of sexual violence. That being said, I definitely think that what these men are saying is we didn't get a fair shot. The process wasn't fair. And sometimes, what they're also asking through these lawsuits is for the federal courts to step in and change the results or order the school to conduct the investigation in a different way. And that's part of what some of these class actions are asking for.", "completion": " But what is likely to happen if the men succeed and these lawsuits gain class-action status? I mean, could it upend how these cases are treated?"}
{"prompt": " I mean, if they did gain class-action status, which I personally think is pretty steep thing for them to get, I think that it could result in a lot of these either being kicked back to the school and these students and the survivors having to go through all of this again, and it also has a wider reaching impact as far as what students who are going through these circumstances see and think as far as reporting. And that's one of the things that I see as a concern.", "completion": " Yeah. What message does it send to the victims?"}
{"prompt": " Right. What message does it send to the victims who have already been a minority of people who report, and because the school didn't do it the right way, that their situation is not validated. And I do think that it can have a real chilling impact on other survivors reporting and coming forward and saying, as we have said in recent years, #MeToo because they think it just may come back and not matter.", "completion": " So I want to ask you, Title IX has been in the news for a while now, especially in the wake of #MeToo, as you mentioned. It's also become very political. Do you see Title IX as the best tool for this kind of process? Or is it one that has been overused and should be replaced with something else?"}
{"prompt": " Yeah. Ninety percent of what we consume from iPhones to running shoes comes across the sea on cargo vessels, and 50% of the oxygen we breathe is produced by the oceans. And seafood is a massively expanding source of protein for much of the planet. The oceans are the temperature stabilizer for countering climate change's effect. So in all these ways, it's a pretty essential part of the planet.", "completion": " Let's talk about the global fishing industry. You write in this book that the world wants to believe, quote, \"that it is possible to fish sustainably legally and using workers with contracts making a livable wage and still deliver a five ounce can of skipjack tuna for $2.50 that ends up on the grocery shelf only days after the fish was pulled from the water thousands of miles away.\" I guess when you write like that, it doesn't seem like a very feasible thing that people want. But what is the reality?"}
{"prompt": " Lang Long was courted by a trafficker, a human trafficker, offered a job in the construction industry. Then Lang Long, who had not a cent to his name and couldn't pay the trafficker, now he had a debt, and that trafficker sold Lang Long to a fishing boat captain, and off they went. And because Lang Long had attempted to escape at one point, Lang Long was subsequently shackled by the neck whenever he wasn't working. And that shackling is what got noticed by a supply vessel that serviced one of these fishing boats. And that became a whole long negotiation to buy Lang Long's freedom. And for the next couple years, I sort of tracked him as Lang Long attempted to put his life back together.", "completion": " And, of course, you make the point that even as the people on the ocean are being treated this badly, the ocean itself is receiving treatment that is also terrifying. Illegal dumping is turning the ocean into a trash can. What is the health of the ocean like as you see it?"}
{"prompt": " The health of the ocean is not great. I think it's especially bad for the same reasons that these crimes against the people occur in that it's vast and therefore under policed. And I think there's also this long-held view that because it's so huge, it is indestructible and self-replenishing. And I think only in recent years have we realized that the dumping of oil, for example, doesn't dilute and after a while is causing systemic contamination or the industrial level fishing that's been happening for a long time actually is unsustainable. And so fishing stocks all over the world have collapsed, and species are going extinct because we now realize that as big as it is and as many fish as there once were, it's not a bottomless thing, the ocean.", "completion": " Just listening to this, it sounds incredibly bleak. I mean, what should we be doing?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning to you.", "completion": " So what recourse is there for the accusers?"}
{"prompt": " Well, right now, the criminal case is over, at least against Jeffrey Epstein. So the recourse is through the civil cases, the lawsuits against his estate, whether the estate is going to fight those lawsuits, what's going to happen, we don't know. There are also a couple of other defamation cases going on that might reveal more of what happened in this situation.", "completion": " The Southern District of New York yesterday put out a statement asking for more victims to come forward. Might his death actually open the door for more people to feel like they can come forward now without fear and possibly that might open the door to more civil cases being brought against his estate?"}
{"prompt": " Yes. In fact, this death might open the door for more victims to come forward in a couple of ways. There could be victims out there who want their story told, but they were not comfortable testifying in a criminal case against him. And then there are additional victims who are saying the only way there's going to be justice is to really show the scope of this conspiracy and will come forward and perhaps will bring our civil actions as well.", "completion": " The original indictment talked about a conspiracy. Does that mean that there are more people who can be charged?"}
{"prompt": " Possibly. The prosecutors have said that they're continuing to investigate. Now, they didn't bring charges against any of the co-conspirators when they did charge Epstein, so I'm not sure how likely it will be. But there's a lot of pressure on them now given that Epstein's gone to find out who else was involved and whether they can be criminally charged.", "completion": " And will that evidence collected by the Southern District of New York ever be seen?"}
{"prompt": " I don't know that all of it will be seen. Some of the evidence went to the grand jury, and in order for that to be revealed, you'd have to go to the judge and show a particularized need for disclosure. There's also some FBI reports and other types of evidence and possibly Freedom of Information Act requests - we'll get that. But I don't think you're going to see everything that the prosecutors accumulated and might have presented in the criminal case.", "completion": " Because now there's going to be a bunch of different investigations into the circumstances surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's death, might that reveal some information that otherwise would have been hidden?"}
{"prompt": " Well, that's a possibility because as they look at people, there's all sorts of conspiracy theories already floating out there. And as they start investigating who might have had an interest, who had a motive, might that information come out? It could. But we don't know yet. And many questions still may not be answered. I think for the victims, this is going to be hard because they're never going to see Jeffrey Epstein in court, get what they think is due to him. But I think more of the information still could come out.", "completion": " As you mentioned, there have been a lot of conspiracy theories about Epstein's death. And people are angry. And and I'm wondering, do you share that feeling?"}
{"prompt": " Well, the attorney general put out a statement saying in his words he was appalled by it. They announced that they're going to do inspector general investigations. On Capitol Hill, there was also just a furious response. Senator Ben Sasse - he's from Nebraska - the Epstein investigation was something he questioned Barr about during his confirmation hearing, pressing him to make sure that he was brought to justice. And he put out a statement saying heads need to roll at the Justice Department. Among Democrats, Lois Frankel, who's a member from Florida where Epstein had been accused of crimes as well, she said she wants the House Oversight Committee to investigate not just the non-prosecution deal but, like, how this happened at this prison. So I do think when they come back in the fall, there's going to be a more push for answers here and oversight and accountability to how this was allowed to happen.", "completion": " Let's talk about the issue that's really been preoccupying Congress, even on their August recess, whether or not there will be any legislation on guns in the wake of last weekend's shootings in El Paso and Dayton. The president has at least appeared to be weighing the options. What is he signaling? Do we know?"}
{"prompt": " President Trump is so hard to nail down on this issue because at times, and like he is right now, he does seem to signal a real willingness to take on the gun lobby and to tackle more meaningful gun legislation. He has shown now an indication that he might support background checks or things called red flag laws that would make it harder for people to buy guns if their family or law enforcement thought they were in crisis. But at the same time, when Democrats passed a background check legislation bill early this year that would have done things like close loopholes that let the Charleston shooter buy a gun, he said he would veto it. So it's hard to know and anticipate where he will be, and I think that's something Republicans are really nervous about and looking for because they certainly don't want to take any votes on legislation the president won't support. But if the president won't say what he'll support, they're not sure what they can vote for.", "completion": " And I think that's what Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has been grappling with. He does not intend to bring the Senate back into session he has signaled. But he has expressed that he's open to considering the idea of expanded background checks. So what kind of commitment could we see from him on the new legislation? 'Cause he's the other part of this, right?"}
{"prompt": " Yes. But we are not contributing to fuel any hate. We are contributing because we want President Trump to be reelected. I like the job he's doing as president. I love the way he loves America, the same way that I love America. I named my company Great America Companies in 1972 when I first immigrated to America because I felt this was a great place.", "completion": " President Trump has used the words invasion and killer, according to new statistics, over 500 times when speaking about immigration and immigrants since 2017. That is as president. People see his rhetoric as divisive and specifically when speaking about Latino immigrants. Does that not concern you?"}
{"prompt": " If there is any hate crime, as happened in El Paso, it's by a disturbed individual. It has nothing to do with the president.", "completion": " You came to this country from Peru many years ago. And while you say that the president is speaking about illegal immigration, he has been quoted as using words like infestation, which hark back to very dark periods in American history and history all over the world. When you hear those words, you don't hear him speaking about people like yourself?"}
{"prompt": " You know, the way I see it is he speaks his mind. And I take from there only what I want to hear.", "completion": " Do you agree with his rhetoric, though, those words? Do you agree with him?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning, Lulu.", "completion": " So you heard Beto O'Rourke there specifically call out the president. What are we likely to hear from Republicans today?"}
{"prompt": " Well, we have already heard from the president in terms of the Texas shooting. He did respond on Twitter just calling it a hateful act. I'm sure following the back-to-back shootings, it will elevate the need for a presidential response. I think we still have so many unknowns about the motives and what exactly played out. Those factors will change how both the president and Washington responds. You know, we can say that these moments are tricky for Trump. These moments where requiring sort of a national empathetic response have not always been his natural strength. If anything, these have been moments that have proven difficult in his presidency. If you recall after the Charlottesville - the white nationalist uprising there that led to deaths, he gave a very controversial response in which he had praised very fine people on both sides. That prompted rounds of condemnation of its own. At the same time, after the high school shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, he gave a more robust response. He had a big event at the White House talking about gun violence and the need to do more and has at times been sympathetic to the idea of changing gun laws in this country, although, ultimately, during his administration, nothing has changed or nothing major has changed in terms of gun laws.", "completion": " Susan, I want to talk a little bit about the investigation into the shooting in Dayton, Ohio, which is just beginning because this happened overnight. Can you tell us what we know so far?"}
{"prompt": " Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley had a press conference this morning. She did confirm 10 were dead, including the shooter, who was killed by police; another 26 were injured. The shooting took place outside of a bar around 1 a.m. People were lined up outside. The mayor did note that this was the 250th shooting in America so far this year.", "completion": " So when we look at that number, which is an extraordinary number, you know, these shootings are, again, prompting calls, mainly from Democrats, to change gun laws. Are we likely to see the same cycle of response?"}
{"prompt": " Probably because this is a very familiar thing. You know, I've covered the response to probably 10 or more mass shooting events in the past decade. And there's a very familiar battle line of how people view these things. I do think in this circumstance we may be seeing a bit of a different debate because of the Texas shooting and the questions raised about whether or not this was a hate crime and an act of domestic terrorism, which is...", "completion": " Because it's two different things, right?"}
{"prompt": " Hi. Good morning, Lulu.", "completion": " What is the latest information that we have this morning?"}
{"prompt": " Indeed. In his State of the Union Address this year, President Trump incorrectly attributed El Paso's safety record to the construction of the border wall. But statistics show El Paso has had a low crime rate compared to other cities its size well before the presence of a border wall. The number of people killed and injured in yesterday's mass shooting is higher than the average number of people murdered here in an entire year. And I should point out that a border wall would in no way have stopped the shooter from committing yesterday's massacre. Also, because of its location on the U.S.-Mexico border, the city is home to a plethora of law enforcement - federal, state and local - who keep a close watch on the city. And, finally, cities - studies show that cities like El Paso with a large immigrant population tend to have lower crime rates.", "completion": " Do we know anything more about the victims? What have we learned?"}
{"prompt": " Not too much yet. Police have said that they range in all ages. Former El Paso congressman and now-presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke told reporters yesterday that he spoke to the wife of a soccer coach who was wounded while fundraising for his team at the Walmart. Mexican officials have also reported via Twitter that there are six Mexicans injured, including a 10-year-old girl, and three others are among the dead.", "completion": " I mean, this must be an incredibly difficult time in El Paso right now, you know, something this horrific happening. There were so many families at the Walmart, as you mentioned. And it is now being investigated as a potential hate crime. So I'm wondering - how have the people there reacted to this terrible tragedy?"}
{"prompt": " Hi, Lulu.", "completion": " What do we know so far about this latest seizure?"}
{"prompt": " Well, it occurred near Farsi Island - that's north of the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Iranian media are quoting Revolutionary Guard Corps officials as saying the ship was detained after it allegedly received fuel from other vessels in order, they say, to transfer it to unnamed Gulf Arab states that Iran says amounts to a fuel smuggling. And smuggling of subsidized Iranian fuel is a real issue in the Gulf. There's profit to be made selling cheaper Iranian fuel at higher prices elsewhere. But at this point, we don't have any confirmation that this vessel was doing that. And beyond that, we know that the seven crew members have been detained. And we're waiting for additional information.", "completion": " We've been hearing these stories of seizures - right? - and threats for months, usually, though, involving British-flagged vessels. Remind us how this has developed. How did we get here?"}
{"prompt": " It lives on. And as you said, it is inching forward. I was checking this morning - NPR has an impeachment tracker where we've been tracking every member that comes forward for impeachment - and it's now at an even 100. Although, I should say that before Robert Mueller testified, it was at about 95. So we haven't exactly seen a big groundswell of impeachment following his testimony. I think the Congress reflects, right now, where the country is - there's a bunch of people really for it, a bunch of people really against it and not much moving in one direction or the other. The Congress is largely stuck on the question of impeachment.", "completion": " How do you think this six-week break will change the dynamics of the situation? What do you think Democrats and Republicans are going to hear from their constituents? And is that going to change how they act when they get back here?"}
{"prompt": " ...In the House Republican conference - yeah, they are now - they will be down, unless they elect more women, to just 11 women, which would be essentially the lowest watermark part it's been since they've started electing women. Just 20 years ago, there was more than double that. So it does speak to the sort of recruiting challenges and appeal to women that the Republican Party has that is one of these big, structural problems that they need to address.", "completion": " This week - another set of Democratic debates. We'll have a look from the candidates' side of the equation elsewhere in the program. But I want to ask you something from the viewers' perspective. If you're in the kitchen right now, and you're worried about health care or the environment, whatever, what are you going to learn about that by watching the debates this week?"}
{"prompt": " ...Skeptical that the style of these debates does much. It does kind of feed the reality TV-ification (ph) of our politics in the sense that it's more about entertainment. One thing I do think we're all watching for, though, is to see where - what the Democratic Party ultimately is going to stand for in the 2020 election. You still have this immense sort of intellectual debate going on in the party of whether it's going to move more to the left and be a more progressive party or hold on and try to reclaim or be the party of the center. And we simply don't know the answer to that question yet. And whether the nominee is someone like a Joe Biden or someone like a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren is going to be two dramatically different Democratic parties and two dramatically different general elections. So I think the big topics that we've been hearing a lot in these debates is health care. One thing I think we're going to hear a lot more about in this debate is immigration just because that is an issue that has increasingly been captivating the public because of what's been happening at the U.S.-Mexico border and because of President Trump's immigration policies.", "completion": " And just briefly, what do you make of the fear that some Democrats have expressed that much of what's being talked about at these debates are sort of the pet causes of the left, which are just not relevant to the general electorate?"}
{"prompt": " Yes. Well, I think it clearly is - both things are going on at the same time. I think Fox News gives him the ammunition he needed, and he gave it probably about, you know, two seconds of thought to find an opportunity to slam Representative Cummings who, of course, has been critical of his border policy, and so he took it. And so 750,000 people woke up in the 7th District yesterday being told that they were the worst place in the country by the president of the United States.", "completion": " When you first read those tweets, what was your thought?"}
{"prompt": " Well, I think you've really hit the nail on the head. That's the - that is the professional problem that we all have in covering this president. But if you have this carefully considered, you know, sort of - you know, this is some academic or intellectual argument, it's going to be - fall on deaf ears as well. So at some point, you know, you have to take the measure of the moment and decide where you're going to go. And I think, you know, this particular tweet that - actually series of tweets and somewhat echoed again this morning - is just beyond the pale. I mean, it's just so obvious what's going on. It's just not excusable, so you just have to stand up for the people who don't have a voice in this.", "completion": " When you say take the measure of the moment, what is the moment, in your view?"}
{"prompt": " I think it's, you know, a president of the United States deciding to debase himself in the office he holds, and it's attacking a member of Congress who happens to be African American, and it's, I guess, what we wrote, which is that it's - it has a political strategy, and it's a cheap shot.", "completion": " The headline of the editorial called the president a rat, which played off his description of Baltimore as rat-infested. Do you think that's ceding the turf to him by using the kind of insult that he uses?"}
{"prompt": " Good morning. Thanks for having me.", "completion": " As someone who's been quite critical of the president, who's an admirer of Mr. Mueller and who's warned very often of the Russia threat, you've also said that the Democrats need to move on, forget about impeachment and focus on the issues such as health care. Why?"}
{"prompt": " If you look at some of the characteristics I think that would define a successful process for impeachment and you compare that to what we saw with Director Mueller, he had more resources. He had more access to things like documents, emails. He had more access to the technical capabilities of the FBI, and he had more time. Remember; that was 2 1/2 years he spent coming to conclusions that didn't lead us too far down the path. The Democrats come at this from a partisan approach. He was nonpartisan with less time, fewer people, less technical capability. It's hard for me to see how in the next 15 months you can resolve this in a way that leaves us in the summer of 2020 looking back saying that was really good for America.", "completion": " But meanwhile, you have a Senate report of election interference that says literally all 50 states were targeted. And on that very same day, the Senate Republicans block an electoral security bill. If we move on from the central message that Mr. Muller was trying to impart, that we were and are indeed still being attacked by Russia, as someone who has worked in intelligence, isn't that a problem?"}
{"prompt": " Yes, but we're talking about two different issues where one is an issue where we're going after people for lying during the investigative process. The other is an issue that was lost mostly during the hearings last week that we should focus on that you just discussed, which is how we think about Russia. If we spend a little less time on an impeachment process that won't succeed and maybe more time talking about how we help states defend themselves and how we talk to the American people about how they look at Facebook messages next year during the campaign, I think we'd be better off.", "completion": " I know that you feel a particular admiration and closeness to Director Mueller. He appointed you to do your job at the FBI, right?"}
{"prompt": " He did. He did.", "completion": " So how do you feel about how he was treated at the hearings and how he chose to handle them?"}
{"prompt": " Boy, I feel disappointed. If you look at this in context, a man who served both Democrats and Republicans - remember; he was renominated for FBI director by a Democratic president, President Obama - a man who served honorably in Vietnam, a Princeton graduate who decided to go overseas to a war not a lot of people liked at that time, and you looked at some of the attacks he took from Republicans and some of the way he was used by Democrats, I looked at the man I served - and I know people who are listening don't know him - he was an honorable, great man. I mean, I'm 57, and I still have a hero, and that's Robert Mueller. I just don't think he was treated very well during the hearing and, by the way, afterward when people talked about his performance.", "completion": " All right. Let's turn to the book. It's called \"Black Site,\" and it's really a kind of oral history of the post-9/11 CIA. In particular, it was known internally as the program which was the use of black sites in interrogations - still very controversial. Why did you want to write this book?"}
{"prompt": " Well, first, I like words. My mom was a teacher, and she taught the family to love words. But in terms of the subject matter, you go back in time and you realize the immediacy of what we lived through. I still remember it almost every day. For years, I thought we were losing the battle against al-Qaida. And I thought if I didn't talk to my friends who will never speak and tell their story, try to have people - even if they don't like what we did, have people stand in our shoes, that the story, the immediacy, would be lost. So I wanted to use the words that my mom taught me and talk about a program in a time in American history that might be lost if I didn't write it.", "completion": " Those black sites, rendition sites, were deemed illegal, were vilified, and it seemed to many Americans that there was sort of a collective passing of the buck when it came to these kinds of decisions. You talked to people who worked in the black sites. What don't we understand about the people who made those decisions?"}
{"prompt": " I don't think that's true. I think that despite what the president has said, I think - and I don't apologize for what we did all those years ago, but America's learned a lot. It's learned that - some people in this country, including members of Congress, don't like what we did. It's given people across this country a chance to reflect on what we did. But that reflection, I think, requires people also to step back to the spring of 2002 when we got our first prisoner and say, am I sure? Am I sure, before I critique the CIA, that I know what it was like? And I wanted to give them a chance to have that opportunity.", "completion": " When you look back, yourself at that time, would you do anything differently?"}
{"prompt": " Morning, Lulu. Thanks for having me on.", "completion": " What's the latest on today's protests? Are there more on the streets, or did yesterday's arrests deter action?"}
{"prompt": " So the protests are going to pick up again in a week. These protests started again two weeks ago. And at first, they were going every day. There were daily protests, one each evening after work with a big protest scheduled last week. About 20,000 people came out for that one. And then they took a week off and came out again yesterday. At the end of the protest, the opposition leaders called for another one next Saturday. The idea is that they're going to keep coming out regularly, but they are, you know, trying to stretch it out as long as possible.", "completion": " What happened to the protesters that were arrested? Do we know?"}
{"prompt": " Usually what happens is that they get detained for about, you know, 10 to 12 hours and then released. Some get fines, and then there are a few who are still in prison waiting for court hearings on Monday; not exactly sure about the number, but it's not that many. Most people actually were released by the - about midnight or 2 a.m. yesterday.", "completion": " So we know that the issue is about city councils, which seem such a basic thing, city councils - why won't electoral authorities let some of the opposition candidates run?"}
{"prompt": " That's a good question because most outside analysts, you know, have looked at this and said, you know, all of this anger would have dissipated way longer ago if you would just let a few through. Some of the speculation is that last year when Kremlin-backed gubernatorial elections were taking place across the country, a bunch of them lost. And so the Kremlin is apparently quite nervous about any sort of non-Kremlin candidates going through. There has been economic stagnation for the past few years here. And Vladimir Putin's and the ruling United Russia Party's ratings have been dropping steadily. And so any sort of opposition, at the moment, is worrying for the Kremlin.", "completion": " Is this a sign the Russians are turning against Putin's government?"}
{"prompt": " I mean, it's a bit early to say. I think one of the interesting things about this protest is that, as you said, these elections are ostensibly - you know, it's a really small election. They're quite meaningless. The Moscow city council doesn't even get access to the city's budget, but it's united quite a large group of people. Last night, there were about 10,000 people out in the street. The week before, there were 20,000. So I think it shows it's a sort of gauge of the temperature, more or less, that people are frustrated about something. But to say turning against the government is quite strong. I mean, Moscow is a city of 11 million people, and we saw 10,000 people on the streets yesterday.", "completion": " And just briefly, what's been the reaction from the American government, if any?"}
