 Yes. Yeah, actually, whenever I get together with friends of mine who don't work for newspapers, I realize how much more fun I have than they do. There are a lot more pressures. I have to worry about budgets. I have to worry about the careers of other people. But the reality is I come into the newsroom every morning with about 10 things that I want to get done in terms of coverage. I can influence coverage of everything from how we write about music, to how we write about Supreme Court nominees, to how we cover the most interesting city in America. That's a blast. You can't complain too much about that.--- Do you believe--and you talked about this briefly, but I'm curious in terms of how you see the general public and their perception of the media and newspapers. Do you believe that newspapers, television news, etc., now sit in the seat of having to win the confidence of the viewer, the listener, the reader back?--- 

###

 Domenico, congratulations again, and thank you. --- What do you think is the best thing you've ever done?
 To tell you the truth, I started to cry. I was a little disappointed. There's some financial effects, and then there's also just - it's kind of demeaning to be considered basically a second-class citizen. That's how I feel. You know, I pay taxes. I'm a citizen. I'm a grown woman with a partner of 10 years and a 22-month-old child that I've adopted. My partner had the baby. And we're a family with a house, and we're really like a boring couple. And yet, New York state doesn't consider us a family.--- You said there were financial repercussions. What were those?--- And it's kind of discouraging. You know, when people think of New York, what comes to mind from the news? Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Wall Street. Waterfront property. We're like, well, what if we took some of these things off the table? And that was so demoralizing and dem--- What do you think about the fact that New York state doesn't consider you a family?
 Right. Which, of course, supposes that these are not objective. The funny thing is that the GOP is assuming - as I said - that this will necessarily favor Hillary Clinton. I don't think the Clintons - they've been silent on this, but speaking to their associates, I don't think they make any such assumption at all. And already these projects have also drawn fire from the left, who fear that it could go quite the other way.--- What is the criticism? What is the fear coming from the left about these things?--- You touch on the fact that a number of factors may be at play here. The candidates and their advisers are concerned that simply having one debate - and this gets down to those inner workings - could the subject of which videos the moderator posts online or shows might be yet another thing to leak. The candidates themselves are probably concerned--- Well, let's talk a little bit more about these projects. What are they about?
 To some extent, China is more able than the United States to set ambitious targets for things like renewable energy. But I would say in the last eight to ten years in the United States, there has been a tremendous amount of path-breaking work going on at the state level, particularly in California. And some of the policies that California has put into place, such as its very ambitious solar energy incentives have become the model for China.--- You've been working on this issue in China for, what, 15 years?--- So today, China is far and away the leader in solar power, and that didn't happen by accident. 

###

 What about battery technology?uria1953(loretta.oriahour@gmail.com): Question is, will there be a market for it? I mean, as far as I--- So what do you see ahead for the United States?
 There are so many incredible writers out there on Twitter and so many really compelling firsthand accounts of the big news stories this year that it makes for a really interesting way to recap some of those big events.--- How in the world did you decide which tweets to preserve in this book?--- What are you putting out there today for us? --- Well, let's talk a little bit more about that. I mean, what do you think is going to be the big news this year?
 You know, that would be a difficult one to impose and to regulate. I think the strength of the lobbying law is that it is so narrowly defined - covering the most important piece of lobbying, which is contacting Congressmen and covered officials.--- But are there a lot of people in Washington who would pass the litmus test of, say, not being a lobbyist, but who are, you know, big influential players, who are being compensated to a great extent because they are former powers on Capitol Hill or in the executive branch?--- So, that is not likely to get in the way of current regulatory schemes. 

###

 Final thing is this. Do we have any idea if this change is having any sort of deterrent effect on the amount of money that foreign governments and agents are donating to influence U.S. policy? --- Do you think that the lobbying law is going to be changed?
 I think it is backfiring on President Trump's critics. When you overshoot the mark and you turn the dial to 11 on every single issue, I think the American public starts to tune you out.--- I just want to be really careful because you're saying that the public might tune you out - when you say you, you're talking about President Trump's critics like Democrats? Are you talking about the media? Who are you referring to?--- So the Democrats certainly hope that some of this sort of overreach on President Trump's part time is going to have the effect of taking the Senate it back for the Democrats. 

###

 And if it does, will 30 additional Republican senators become windbags like Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when they're in the minority--- Well, let me ask you this. I mean, what do you think the president's critics are saying?
 Thank you, Steve. Nice to be with you.--- Can you describe the tone or the attitude of the North Koreans you met with?--- 

###

 Let's talk about your business. You are a publisher. You've published Commentary, and there's also An Illustrated Weekly Standard. How are you planning to survive this economic climate? --- So let's start with this. You've been reporting on this for a couple of weeks now. What's the latest?
 I think, frankly, what I get from a lot of them is that my politics are their politics. I'd be the better candidate and I'd be the better governor. But it's really someone else's turn. And I think the problem with that is that the people who need a change, the ones who can't wait, aren't a part of that conversation. The establishment have all the options and all the influence and connections to protect their interests, frankly, no matter who is in power from whatever party. But everybody else, in my view, is the responsibility of the chief executive, and that's the responsibility I'm looking to assume.--- And what of those who are not the powerbrokers? One has to start to lay the seeds, if you will, particularly in one's own community. Are you seeing excitement from the African-American community as a collective in Massachusetts? And, again, as we grow this countrywide, are you hearing and seeing from African-Americans in other states who are excited about this possibility?--- 

###

 As you said, there's a convention coming up in Orlando, just the year before, your home state. And at that convention, you're going to be affirmatively campaigning or, at least, making an appearance for the first time. What do you want to accomplish out of that appearance?--- What do you think about the fact that you're the first African-American governor in the U.S. since World War II?
 Thank you.--- In your experience, does the breakthrough often come from an eyewitness, from actual forensic evidence on the ground? How do you find out how something like this began?--- Does it give you pause to think, perhaps, we have passed on some of our most qualified people to sometime because we've exported them at a very early age? --- So, first of all, how did you get into this business?
 So, it's certainly not a one-man show and if there's one dominant personality, I would say that today it's Omar Suleiman.--- And do you think that Suleiman is in control of these pro-Mubarak protesters who have been blamed for violence around Tahrir Square and elsewhere?--- He's the most recognizable face today, even among the journalists, because he's become this sort of moral compass for all the protesters. He was at their first assembly on Wednesday night, he spoke to them from the microphone and urged them to stay calm, to walk through the square, he said to them, the president--- So, Omar Suleiman is the host of the show?
 One day, the Brelands were called out to China Lake to the weapons research station out there to do some research with the U.S. Navy's dolphin program, training dolphins to do things like locate submarines or warn of enemy attack, things like that. And this was run by Bob Bailey, who was kind of an animal behaviorist of his own. And he was convinced to come work with the Brelands at the I.Q. Zoo.--- So the CIA, they were trying to train animals and they saw, you know, these people could train a pig to vacuum, they must be able to do something. What were some of the animals the CIA wanted to put to work?--- And he sees what he was doing kind of like kind of human apes, you know. Human beings are intelligent, apes are even more so. And some folks think dolphins are even more. So he's kind of keeping his other animals waiting, bringing out the dolphins. But the dolphins were behaviorists, just like Bob--- So what happened to the dolphins?
 Basically, the town west from Main Street, you could stand on Main Street and look west and see the next town, which is 10 miles away, which you shouldn't be able to do. Things were leveled. It was debris about four feet deep. There was a picture in the, I think, the New York Times or somewhere that showed on top Hiroshima and on the bottom Greensburg. And it was very similar.--- How did you rebuild the town?--- 

###

 And speculation widely - at that time, widely accepted that if this - the impact of the bomb had been one-third of one degree further to the north, it would have been a desert there. That's how little vapor was coming off the ground. And did this convince you that the nuclear--- What was the scene like in Greensburg at that time?
 Oh, that's central to it for sure. What we know, of course, is that some of those folks have severe disabilities by virtue of addiction or mental illness or physical or developmental disability. So we've learned they need permanent housing would support services. The old way of attempting to deliver services when a person's on the street or living in a shelter, you can't do it more ineffectively or more expensively than that. And what we're learning is when you provide, actually, stability and a place to live, that housing itself has a therapeutic impact on folk. Those of us who have never been homeless, we take our housing for granted. But for a homeless person, for the first time, they could actually relax. And when a person's relaxed in the setting of stability and security, they're much more amenable to receiving some of those mental health services or addiction services that they might have rejected had they been on the street.--- What do you say the big concern that some people have that by concentrating on housing first then the support services, you let people move into housing when they all have kinds of problems that aren't necessarily congenial for the neighbors?--- 

###

 One of the arguments that's been made against this new law, in fact, someone in the state legislature even compared this to castrating addiction, which sounds pretty harsh. And this law is going to allow cities to essentially define how many people can be on the street at a time in order for--- Now, when you talk about people who are homeless, what do you mean by that?
 You know, I think they were, in many cases. And I reported from Iraq from 2006 through 2008. And, Robert, I dug up some of my old stories, and one was from 2006. And General George Casey, the top commander at the time, predicted that in the next year and a half or so, the Iraqi forces would be independent and need very little help from the Americans. Then I found a story from a year later, 2007, and a major report found it would take another 12 to 18 months. So a competent and independent Iraqi military was always just over the horizon.--- Just 18 months away. The U.S. worked with Iraqi troops for seven to eight years. Isn't that enough time to have built a better force than Iraq now has?--- This is not surprising to anyone who's been paying attention for a while. And, of course, the road to the ISIS stronghold, the Mosul area, is a road that was not taken seriously by U.S. forces when they had control of that ground. General James Mattis, when he was still the secretary of--- And what about the U.S. role in that?
 Well, one of the biggest changes is accountability, the way people keep track of where their money went and how it's being used. Also social networking, the way people connect with other people who are giving or the organizations themselves. And also just the physical ways that people are donating. People can donate by texting the word kettle to the Salvation Army, a quick $5 donation via your mobile phone. It doesn't really get any easier than that.--- I just want to make sure I understand that. I text the word kettle and the Salvation Army automatically gets $5 from me?--- So is it a matter of people saying that, well, sure, I can give Tim and then I just go on with my day and then it's just forgotten, or is it really a way of, you know, keeping track of where your money's going? --- Now, when you think about the Salvation Army, what are some of the changes that you've seen over the years?
 Well, with respect to polls, my guess is 99 percent of Americans have never even heard of this agency, and I would defy you to find a poll otherwise. To some extent, it's hard to judge precisely what they have done. Again, there are very important laws that need to be enforced. I think in some respects, in certain cases, they have, but in other cases, they've really let us down.--- Just so you know the source of what I was saying, that there was a Morning Consult poll about 11 months ago that polled Trump voters actually and found that 56 percent want the CFPB either left alone or actually expanded. And it is one of the few agencies that focuses solely on consumers. I just want to ask you a broad question. I mean, you had President Trump who ran and still campaigns on being a champion of working Americans. Now, this agency that was set up to protect consumers from abuse is under attack. And you also have a Republican tax cut plan that gives the most relief to wealthy people. I just wonder - is all of this keeping the promise that President Trump made in the election?--- 

###

 Let me draw you out on some specific regulatory actions, and it seems like in 2009 the Treasury Department launched an investigation into Citigroup. They placed many of its operations in a conservatorship - into what's called a government conservatorship, and yet the bank was actually profitable at that point--- Do you have any sense of whether or not the U.S. government is going to be able to enforce these laws?
 Correct. Discovered that we had it.--- And when did you have the surgery?--- Talk about that more with us. I know in 2016 you published a paper in Nature saying you thought, oh well, maybe it was left by a comet then. Or it wasn't. But you - it's not. It's extraterrestrial, yes? --- And what did you find?
 I think there is a small connection. It's not the major reason that rates are going up, but I suspect that chairman Greenspan wants to make sure that inflation is well-controlled on the day he walks out of office, both to protect his own legacy and to make life a little easier for his successor, whoever that may be.--- Who might that be?--- So it is in his interest to make sure that inflation is well-controlled, as long as he has some way of doing that. 

###

 Now, he's not walking out right away, but his term is up in January of 2007. So if we do have no rate hike this month, will--- Well, let's talk about the Fed chair, Jerome Powell. He's a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and he's also a former governor of New York. And he's been in the news for a couple of weeks now. What's going on with him?
 I think it will be. It'll be very disorienting, at first, because - you know, people are used to turning on their computers and seeing a certain something. And in the case of Windows, that certain something for 20 years has been a desktop environment. Now, suddenly, that desktop environment isn't there anymore. There aren't the icons, the folders; the things that we're all used to, in Windows. There are these colorful tiles. And they have to know how to get from those files to the desktop, where they can do their productive work.--- How easy will it be for current Windows users, to upgrade to this new Windows 8?--- 

###

 They're not the only ones learning, I guess. I do notice, no matter how smoothly an operating system is going, there are always people grousing about it (laughter). And you're - there's a certain amount of grousing going on about Windows 8, isn't there? --- What about people who want to do their work on the computer?
 Well, a lot of things have happened in the interim. Two of the prosecutors who were assigned to the case became judges during this period, believe it or not. That's how long it's been, and they had to reconfigure the prosecution team. Phil Spector has had three different sets of lawyers, and now he has Bruce Cutler. And Bruce Cutler was the lawyer in New York who represented John Gotti; he's kind of known as a mob lawyer, a very enthusiastic, very flamboyant lawyer in the courtroom. He'll be something else to watch when you're watching on television.--- Well, speaking of flamboyant, in the run-up to this trial, Linda, I have seen some - I can only say amazing photos of Phil Spector's get-ups, his wigs and - I mean can you just try to describe his fashion sense for us? And do you think that's going to make this trial like a viewing sensation?--- 

###

 The last time we talked, Your Honor Judge Hudson was saying he wanted to try Phil Spector separately, if the jury finds him not guilty by reason of insanity. Is that still a possibility, or has that gone away? --- Now, let's talk about Bruce Cutler. He's a former federal prosecutor in New York. He joined the prosecution after the Gotti trial. What do you know about him?
 That's right.--- Why did you want to highlight--and I think I know the answer to this--but why did you decide to highlight Detroit?--- And it's very unusual. What do you plan to do with the money from the auction? --- What do you mean by that?
 It's not at all unexpected. If anything, investors and some people in the auto industry had been begging Ford to make this step. General Motors Corp. earlier this year did something quite similar. And it's really the only way Ford can get its workers out of the existing UAW contract in a way that's amenable to the union. They have a contract and if they wanted to fire these workers any other way, they would have to continue paying them.--- The UAW traditionally has been one of the biggest, most powerful labor unions in America. Is the union, because of Ford's woes, being forced to take whatever the company offers?--- 

###

 You know, all this might sound pretty dry and academic except that it's not, it's affecting the real world. I mean, how are people in Memphis and Janesville and Atlanta and northern Michigan feeling about all of this? --- So what happens if the UAW doesn't agree to this?
 Well, I don't change my views regardless of who it is I'm speaking to or working with. I have never made one call or made one office visit on behalf of a client, and I don't intend to because that's not my role. So I don't think there's any conflict at all.--- How confident are you that a health care bill will land on the president's desk for signature before the end of this year?--- 

###

 And I have to ask you because you are a childhood friend of Senator Obama, and you were one of his earliest political supporters, most notably helping to arrange a meeting in 2001 with Bill Richardson when he was considering a presidential run, which helped jumpstart Obama's political career. The president-elect--- Do you have any sense of whether or not this is a conflict of interest or not?
 Most of the tanks are in fact gone now. Most of the tanks that were around the Government House, most of them are gone now. And the presence here today is a lot less than it was two weeks ago in the days immediately following the coup. I think - I think the military feels pretty confident right now. I think they feel like they're in charge, that the bad news that they thought might follow this, that some Thaksin supporters might rise up and say, hey, we're not on board with this thing, that hasn't happened yet. So I think the military is feeling pretty good in fact that a lot of the military has been brought back to barracks, sent back to barracks, I think that's an indication that they're feeling pretty confident.--- And what happens next for the civilian side of this government, if there is one?--- 

###

 What has the reaction of the Asian community there in Minnesota been to all this? Do you have a sense of that? --- You mentioned the military's feeling pretty confident right now. What do you mean by that?
 So we tested that.--- And you found it in how many different kinds of bugs?--- 

###

 Can you give me a hint about how it works? --- So you tested that?
 So in Louisiana, they had a practice on the books that meant that felony convictions could happen with a split jury, so 10-2 or 11-1. And voters said, no, we're going to be like the rest of the country, with the exception of Oregon, and we're going to have unanimous juries for felony convictions.--- And this was a practice considered by many as kind of a carryover from Jim Crow era, right?--- Yolanda Mangaskin, criminal defense attorney, will join me now. YolDonnell? --- And what about the issue of race? I mean, there's been a lot of talk about race in the last couple of years. What do you think is going to change in terms of race in this election?
 One person, actually the aide to Ted Kennedy. Now, the reason I got into Ted Kennedy's office is that he has a book coming out on the adventures of his dog, named Splash. Yes.--- Ted Kennedy has a dog named Splash?--- And I went to his office, apparently I wasn't the only one doing that. And I think I even stayed there for a few hours because his New York - his New York office, anyway, had a little area made just for dogs. And it looked like a whole other room had been scooped out. So--- Well, let's talk a little bit more about the dog. He's named Splash. He was born and raised in New York, and he was adopted by a couple of his siblings. And he's a very well-known figure in the Democratic Party. What do you think he's going to do
 Well, as I understand it right now, the vast majority of the money being put up would be public. Private investors might put up as little as 3 percent equity in some of these partnerships. The Treasury would add more equity from the TARP funds it got from Congress - you know, the $700 billion, which is now down to 300 billion after all the injections of capital into the banks. So the private investors don't have a lot of skin in the game. And the purchases of the assets would be further financed by these low-interest loans from the Fed or the FDIC. Those are likely to be called non-recourse loans, which means that the toxic assets lose money after they're purchased. The private investors would lose only the 3 percent of money they put down, or maybe 10 percent, if they invested that much, and the government would lose the rest. So the taxpayers are on the hook. But if the toxic assets rise in value, there's the prospect of big gains for private investors. Now, some people suggest the downside to taxpayers may be small because these toxic assets are undervalued right now and are unlikely to fall much further but have a bigger chance of increasing in value. We'll just have to see.--- Will there be any congressional involvement?--- 

###

 Well, how do you hold these banks accountable so taxpayers don't end up paying for all of this? And I'll also note you mentioned cheap loans. That's one of the issues with the predatory loans that some of these big banks were making. Do you have any idea how much some of--- Let's talk a little bit more about the government's role in this. It's been under a lot of scrutiny for the past couple of years. What's the role of the government in this?
 We're on the ballot in 11 states, and we have ballot access in another number of states. So we have a total ballot access either as a write-in or appearing on the ballot in 34 to 35 states. By the time we get to Election Day, it will be 43 to 45.--- Before we let you go, as we mentioned, in a longer campaign, we get to know a little bit more about the candidates things like who they are as people, you know, what their families are all about. Can you just tell us a little bit about yourself on a personal level? Are you married? Are you partnered? Do you have kids? What do you like to listen to? What do you do when you're not working?--- So almost 100 percent of the states will have had some opportunity for an African-American vote to appear on the ballot. We're about to see a serious run of "redistricting" this year, and we're on the ballot. 

###

 What legacy will you be leaving in Washington, and do--- Do you have any sense of how many African-American voters are likely to show up to the polls?
 You know, it's such a fine balance, because what I like to do at first is assess their financial situation. If they have a family and they're pretty much short on cash and they don't have a big income, you know, if they're stirring at a contract from Lithuania or Italy, or wherever that is presenting yourself at $20,000 a month, I have them take a long look at that and say, are you aware of what you could possibly be risking? And more often than not, they always say to me, well, I feel like I belong, and just in my gut, and I want to take that chance. Believe it or not, a handful of my guys have, in fact, turned down big contracts, go on to the D-League, and have gone on to make the league and make good money.--- Does play overseas come with the kind of ancillary income that a player can earn in the NBA - the endorsement contracts and commercial contracts and the like?--- I mean, you just have to keep in mind it's not always going to be good, but good is 1,000 percent better than the alternative. And I always stay very calm and very collected about every single situation and say let's take a look at it. 

###

 Do the players treat you--- Do you have any advice for people who are trying to get into the D-League, or do you have some advice for them?
 They are known for a couple of different things. Bob Komer's particularly notable for his work on a grazing settlement between the Bureau of Land Management and a Wyoming rancher. And in that case, that was actually the subject of an Inspector General's report which cited Mr. Komer for pressuring rank and file employees to reach a settlement which was seen as favorable to the rancher in question. And then, Mark McEwen is known more for being a very fierce proponent of property rights and pushing for ranchers and other individuals to have their property rights recognized by the federal government.--- These people will soon report to political appointees of the Obama administration. Would you expect them, based on past history of others, to salute smartly and run up the Hill, or wouldn't they be obstructionist from inside the career service?--- 

###

 And what is the status of their cases? --- Now, you mentioned that Mark McEwen, the president of the National Association of Black Landers, has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration. What do you make of that?
 Good to talk to you. Thank you very much for having me tonight.--- I know that some of your family members were killed in the war. What does this verdict mean to you?--- --- What do you make of the fact that this is the first time that the U.S. has been involved in a presidential election since the 1970s?
 I think that argument is silly. The harder questions really relate to in addition to trying to negotiate to save some lives, was there more that might have been done to encourage others to flee to Romania, to avoid being ghettoized? Could lives, more lives, have been saved if more emphasis had been put on that? But I don't criticize Kastner for entering into negotiation in the hope of trying to save lives.--- When you sort of look at all these cases, is there a way to figure out when to negotiate and when not to?--- I mean, that's the most fundamental moral responsibility of any nation, to do what they can to save lives, even if it turns out that those lives were lost. 

###

 You happen to be in Jerusalem at this point. What is the scene there? --- What do you make of the fact that Kastner has been criticized for trying to negotiate a deal with the U.S.?
 It's still totally unreal when I think about it. It feels so weird to be able to just kind of buy things when I want them or need them.--- What's the most outrageous thing you bought?--- I've still got to pinch myself, I'll never get used to this. So as someone, since you mentioned traveling, you've been to a lot of different places. Looking back on your childhood, when was Baltimore a foreign country for you? --- What do you think about the fact that you have to go out and buy a lot of things?
 Thank you.--- We turn now to a developing story in Afghanistan. More than 100 people are reported dead from a Friday attack on an Afghan military base, making it the deadliest attack there since 2001. Taliban fighters disguised as Afghan military attacked the base as soldiers were observing Friday prayers at Camp Shaheen near Mazar-e-Sharif, the nation's third largest city. And since the attack, the death toll has risen steadily. To help us understand what this attack means in the years-long struggle to contain the insurgency in Afghanistan, we've reached Ahmed Rashid. He's a journalist and author of several books on Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Taliban. He joins us from Lahore, Pakistan. Ahmed, welcome back to the program. What makes this incident so significant?--- 

###

 So where do things go from here? --- So, first of all, how did you get into this business?
 Car buying, there's been a--it's hard to look at, you know, this momentary flash because of gasoline prices. SUV sales have gone down--I think it's about 15 percent over two years. It's been a fairly steady--I mean, I think it's more leveling off. People are leaving the bigger SUVs, going to crossovers, that sort of thing. It's been a leveling off. It's still going to be a significant part of our market, even though they're in some disfavor right now. Pickup trucks and SUVs and minivans are all called light trucks, and they're going to continue to make up almost half of all the vehicles sold in the country. What auto dealers, at least in New England, have told me is that they're not seeing so much people saying, `Get me out of this SUV, and get me into a Toyota Prius.' They're seeing, `Get me out of this big SUV, and get me into a small SUV,' such as the Ford Escape.--- So they're downsizing just a little bit?--- 

###

 Talking with Bob Burg mand Auto Week. It's produced by the Interstate Engineering Research Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We want to talk now with Roger Martin, who's the dean of the D'Amore-McKim School of Business at the University of Maryland. Dean Martin, welcome to--- Now, you mentioned the Ford Escape. It's been in the news for a couple of years now. What's going on with that?
 Yeah, I think that--one of the things I think has happened is that there have been several different movements happening at the same time. But if you'd go onto a Google site and you tried to find--put down May Day or May 1st Immigrant Demonstration, you'll be referred to websites of groups that are, let's say, largely outside the mainstream. I mean, in other words, what you're really seeing, I think, is a battle between a sort of extremist nativist position on the one hand, and…--- That would be the Minutemen and groups like that?--- …and on the other a much broader sense of concern over the economic stress felt by, let's say, first generation immigrants or the fear of economic decline felt by African-Americans, for example, that try to make us talk about class and economic pressure. Now, there's a certain amount of truth to that.--- What do you mean by that?
 The thing that's most likely is that the female actually ovulates over a fairly long period, so all of the embryos are actually at different stages of development. One of the things that's important is the male that mates with the female first has a big advantage, as far as having the embryo that reaches the size where it starts to kill and eat its siblings. And one thing that's very interesting about sand tigers in captivity, when mating is being observed the males actually form a dominance hierarchy. And the dominant male actually guards the female and prevents other males from mating with her. And that might be a strategy to actually ensure that he's the one, the dominant male is the one to fertilize those earliest eggs which are then going to become the cannibals.--- Do you see this, this embryonic cannibalism in any other sharks or is it just the sand tiger sharks where this happens?--- So they might use that to ensure a monopoly of the most early embryos. It happens only once or twice a year in the wild, so it's hard to trace where the young finches go to.

 When you think about the extinction pressures that the birds now face, with the modification of their--- And so how does this work? I mean, how does it work?
 Thank you.--- It's said that you're supposed to help reshape the party's message for the working class. Why you?---

 From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES. I'm Farai Chideya. Drought has been hard on struggling farmers across the country, but it's been especially tough on the African-American owned farms of rural Arkansas. In May, the state had more unemployment claims than jobs--- So, first of all, how did you get into this business?
 Good morning, Steve.--- OK. So two Republicans, which we'll talk about, but also three Democrats are considered swing votes. Who are they?---### However, is it a two-step when you talk about securing the border and ending immigration raids? --- What do we know about this investigation?
 Well, you know, Congress created that tax break early last year when foreclosures and short sales, they were just pounding down the housing prices. And, you know, very few people want to buy a house when they can see that the prices are still dropping. So Congress thought it really needed to do something to step in and help. And the idea here was that if taxpayers would just help make housing a little more affordable, young families could buy houses, and that would start to put a floor under prices. So, Realtors predicted that once the prices started to rise on starter homes, the whole market could stabilize and heal itself from the bottom up. And it helped a bit, but it's just not clear at this point that those gains are sustainable. After that tax credit expired at the end of April, the market crashed again. We saw new home sales plunge 33 percent in May, and that's very discouraging. Now, the companies that track real estate say the prices are starting to slide again in a lot of cities.--- Well, can Congress create a new round of tax credits this fall?--- And I think that if you're getting close to selling, you should probably look at financing to see if you can get a little extra cash that way. If houses have been dropping in price, that means it wasn't a good time to get into the market if you're just starting out. 

###

--- Well, let's talk a little bit more about the housing market. There's been a lot of talk about the impact of the tax credit. What's been the reaction to that?
 Right.--- He seemed to have some great sense of humor about what he was doing up there. Or do I have that wrong?--- 

###

 I wonder if I can get you to just talk about some of the individual components and describe some of the philosophical differences that you and Senator Paul have. You are clearly more libertarian in your approach to foreign policy. How would you describe where he is coming from? --- What do you mean by that?
 Well, it looks like the rest of the ocean. I mean, the surface of the ocean is disturbed by way of which, which reflect light. So satellites can see it. Only like spy planes and low-flying aircrafts can actually see down into the water. But some fishermen can spot these large agglomerations of debris that the ocean has knitted together. We've picked up one, weighed a couple hundred pounds. It had a toothbrush in it. Even though, it was mostly composed of net and tarps and stuff like that.--- Is it mostly marine debris or what else do you see?--- 

###

 And what has been done with this junk? --- And what kind of debris are we talking about?
 This is just a few months in that long path.--- They actually had turned the machine on for a test and had gotten some results, hadn't they, on this?--- But again, just recall that this was a primary between two viable candidates. 

###

 Right. Exactly. Exactly. All right, one more question - do you have time for one more? --- What do you see ahead for the United States?
 Well, you know, I reviewed for years myself and then I still do occasionally, and you can kind of get into the habit of destroying things. It's much more interesting and much more difficult to try and show why good things are good. You know, there's a thrill to kind of trying to destroy something, and David feels it.--- Is that to create some thrill in his life?--- And instead of destroying something, he's trying to rebuild past success with, you know, heroes. 

###

 The other thing I thought was interesting - he puts all these various stamps on these letters that are all sort of, like, appealing to kind of a broader sense of what it means to be a--- Well, let's talk a little bit more about that. You know, I think a lot of people would say, well, you know, we're going to get rid of this, but we're not going to let it go. We're just going to keep it. So, what do you
 Thanks for having me.--- We've just heard Jason Beaubien report that progress is - is mixed. You were in Haiti within hours of the earthquake. You've been back a number of times. What's your impression?--- Our topic for today is baseball salaries. And opening day happens in just a few days, in just a few sleeps, really, for many baseball fans across America. But for the players themselves, it actually means something a bit more special. That's because today is the first day that major league players will actually receive their--- So, first of all, how did you get into this business?
 Cool.--- You're faithful, very faithful to the song. Did you listen a lot to the originals again in order to do this album?--- What have we missed this week? --- So, you know, we're going to talk about this in a moment. But first, let's talk about the U.S. military. It's a lot more complicated than it was a few years ago. How do you feel about that?
 There'll be - well, it's about an 18-minute mile pace, which is a very slow run, but a pretty decent pace when you're walking, especially for 26 miles.--- Have you allowed yourself to start thinking about Sunday night and how you might be celebrating - hopefully celebrating?--- What will he be running in a race - because of his record - expected to run in the New York City Marathon? --- So what's the best way to go?
 …including our colleagues in Malaysia and Singapore. We're getting rather close to Thailand. They're not sure quite how far it went. But this dispatch said things about the Thai foreign minister, questioning his sanity. It was really not the sort of material that you would want to see distributed that widely. The tradition was eventually brought to a halt in 2006 after a very funny valedictory dispatch from our ambassador to Rome, Sir Ivor Roberts.--- What did he say?--- And it involved a report that all Belgians had been rounded up and shot. And he said the headline coming out of Brussels was - in his words - "all dead, Brussels." Well, years after that, we still haven't had anything similar. We do get some material found in Embassy pouches. But--- What's the significance of this?
 So what you might expect are some short-term disruptions. But long-term, these things tend to fix themselves surprisingly quickly.--- The most recent huge natural disaster in Japan was the Kobe earthquake of 1995. What were the economic consequences of that?--- I think a lot of people, including a lot of the activists who've been most affected by this, would welcome having assurances of safety. And so I think that's something - again, that may be debated. But I think one of the things that can be decided right now is what systems and what sort of systems--- So what are some of the things that you're looking at?
 Well, that's a good question. They weren't teaching very much. They were exposing their students to a little bit of anatomical dissection and maybe a little bit of physiology lab. And some of the conditions that he found were truly atrocious. And his main criticisms were that they had very poor clinical education, very poor clinical facilities. And what Flexner wanted to do was to have students understand where the knowledge came from and how it was derived, not mainly to learn memorization of facts given in a lecture.--- Dr. Brieger, you're associated with Johns Hopkins, one of the best medical schools in the world, obviously. Do you see on a daily basis the impact today of the Flexner Report?--- And so he ran roughshod over a lot of the training that was in place at the time. 

###

 Now, you write that although Flexner fought for changes, he actually stood by a lot of the traditional structures of medical education. What would he do differently now? --- Well, let's talk a little bit more about the anatomy of the patient. What did he find?
 Yes. I mean, I think we didn't really have a clear conception of what we would find. So most of the previous studies of recent selection in humans have focused on just a handful of genes where there was some prior biological expectation that these might be targets of selection. So one of these, for example, is the lactase gene that's responsible for metabolizing milk in some populations, including Europeans. And our approach is different, because it really allowed us to scan the whole genome in sort of an unbiased way and try to get a sense of what kinds of biological processes are evolving and how much evolution is going on over this very recent time scale.--- Mm-hmm. And you found five different genes involved with skin pigmentation in Europeans?--- 

###

 When you say scans the whole genome, what I guess I'm asking is, did you actually study every single genetic variant in the genome? --- And how did you find that?
 I was actually more irritated with myself. It was getting windy and a storm front was coming in. And so I was looking for somewhere to get out of the wind. And then I found a big pine tree and just started pulling in needles. And then I saw some willow trees, and so I started cutting branches and then basically just tried to cover up. I was wet from going in and out of streams so I stayed awake all night, as I did for the next four nights.--- Mike, what were you surviving on? Did you have any food with you? Any water? What did you do?--- So I stayed awake four nights and that's why I was never really trained, and I didn't have, you know, navigation. 

###

 Was it cold? --- And how did you get out of that?
 Thank you. Glad to be with you.--- Stanley Weintraub, before we get to the actual Christmas in Savannah, I want to start by asking about the march itself. In around the middle of November 1864, Sherman takes 62,000 of his soldiers, marches them through rural Georgia all the way to Savannah. It takes about a month. It became known as Sherman's march to the sea. What was the point of that march to the sea?--- Glad to be with you. I must tell you I am extremely happy to talk to you. I must tell you I am extremely happy to talk to you. A week ago, we talked to a woman named Tory Danner(ph). A week ago, we talked to a woman named Tory Danner(ph),--- So let's start with this. You've been in the news for a long time. What's your reaction to this?
 We do not have enough attorneys. We need more.--- Is there a story you can tell of a child that you've helped?--- In terms of where I am today in my life, I call myself an accidental public servant. I like to call myself a real-life mole. 

###

 Well, what's your role? What do you do? --- You need more attorneys?
 Oh, they've got quite a few boats done got broke loose and went elsewhere. I don't see none (unintelligible) yet. But a lot of ropes got popped. And it was - I'm glad that that's all what happened around here, because it could be a lot worse. And it's not over yet. We're still experiencing a lot of water on the outside. You know, these levees are holding it back, but I don't trust the levees.--- You know, when we talked this morning, you said you were going to try to go by your house. Did you get there?--- They are still with the big wall. It's still crumbling behind us. So we're still not out of the woods yet on this. 

###

 Do you get through this each time, year after year, and each time - I count at least a couple of times - that you've talked about something--- And what about the levees themselves?
 Well, I think that's part of it and what John has said is that that's one of a lot of reasons why he left the paper. I think it would be a mistake to assume that John left in protest. John and I are very close. We talk probably more than we talk to each other's wives. And I can tell you, it's not the only reason he left. He left because he's been running newspapers--this is his third newspaper--he's been running newspapers for more than two decades, and I think he wanted to do something different. I feel that the two of us have spent--we've been partners for the last five years. I know all of the things we've assembled. I know what has to be protected. I don't think of it as much of a firestorm as other people do. Maybe I'm kidding myself, but that's not the way I see it.--- Let me ask you, Dean. It's always interesting when African-Americans take the helm of something, particularly something as prestigious as this. And you being the person who will sit as the captain of this maiden voyage, how much pressure do you feel, if any, being the first African-American to head this post?--- 

###

 Do you have some trepidation about journalism taking off in another direction, or should people who are interested - and they could be anyone - just go ahead and experiment? --- Well, let me ask you this. I mean, you've been running newspapers for more than 30 years. You've been doing this for a long time. What do you mean by that?
 Well, it hasn't been that long ago that people - also high-level members of ISIS or the Islamic State had access to Turkey and were treated at Turkish hospitals. So we know, for example, of about one high-level ISIS fighter who was there just six months ago.--- And as for the flow of material across the border, was it flowing freely? Were the Turks just letting it go through?--- So there still could be the possibility of fugitives hiding from their authorities in hospitals, and this could raise concerns. 

###

 And people who are just coming out of Syria, running from the fighting, would they be able to get treatment - get before a doctor? Is there any kind of screening of these--- Do you have any sense of how the Turkish government is responding to this?
 A lot of them come from West Africa, but they really come from across sub-Saharan Africa. We talked to people from Liberia, from Burkina Faso, from Senegal, from the Gambia. It really was a huge range of people from across West Africa.--- What is Algeria saying about this?--- How was this researcher able to travel so widely and talk to so many? --- And how did they get to the United States?
 Hello, Alex. It's nice to be here.--- Community Counts, this is a YouTube users group that follows YouTube political content, yes? And you're trying to have some influence on what happens with the questions in the debate tonight. What's your goal? What are you trying to do?--- When you think about the fact that we are only two months into Planet Earth year and already we've been treated to an experience that you could only see in the movies - an asteroid nearly colliding with the earth, knock on wood - what's the big takeaway for many people, do you think, when it comes to--- Well, let's start with this. You've been covering the news for a long time. What's been your reaction to this?
 Thanks for having me.--- Can you just describe what it's like in the first kind of minutes or hours after something like this? Like, what goes through your mind?--- 

###

 So there's $700 billion, the biggest bailout in U.S. history. So how much of that money has actually gone out the door? --- So, first of all, how did you get into this business?
 Remember; there have been news reports for a few days now that three Trump campaign advisers or aides met with an FBI asset in the course of the campaign. People close to the investigation say that was because the FBI didn't want word to get out that Trump or the Trump campaign was under investigation for possible collusion with Russians in the course of 2016. So as opposed to calling those aides in and interviewing them quite publicly or taking other steps, they sent an informant in to talk to those folks. Now, this is a counterintelligence investigation, not just a criminal one. And in counterintelligence investigations, the FBI and other government agencies often use these kinds of informants to go in and gather information secretly often to protect the privacy of people who are being investigated. And, Don, these require very high-level approvals at Justice and the FBI. They're not just something one guy can do.--- OK. And there's some additional news today from the president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, about the timetable for special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and a possible interview with the president. Just quickly, what do we know there?--- So there are a lot of governors involved here, and part of the problem here may be that very few people at Justice or the FBI wanted to let this story get out, and that's the problem. 

###

 All right. Let's turn now to the resignations of David Shulkin at the--- Well, let's talk about the FBI's role in this investigation. It's a counterintelligence investigation, right?
 Well, being a porter on Everest is probably the best job going ,if you're a Sherpa in the Khumbu region and you want to stay and work where you live. You can make between $2- and $6,000 in a climbing season. You know, this is in a country where the median income is still around $550 or $600 a year. So the guys who are strong enough and fit enough to do this work make enough money to support not only their own families, but much of their extended families.--- But what happens to these families when high-altitude porters die on the mountain?--- Some of them go off into the mountains themselves to mine their metals. I mean, it's a situation which is an envy of many people in Nepal, particularly young men, one of the few legitimate options for a very long and long way into the future. 

###

 But wasn't it also a situation--- And how do you make that money?
 Hi, Madeleine.--- David, usually these cases are whether or not sperm donors have responsibilities to the children, i.e., whether or not they should pay child support. So how unusual is it to be the reverse, where the sperm donor actually wants to be a part of the child's life?--- How are you? --- Well, let's talk a little bit more about this. What's the latest?
 The other man, Majed Hameed--who worked for us and also for Al-Arabiya television, was detained--and it seems he was detained because sometime earlier there'd been some vague allegations made by unknown third parties. But again, we never had any specific information about why he seemed to have attracted some suspicion.--- And they were picked up the end of last summer?--- And we hope very much, if there were, that the charges against these two men would be folded and they would be released as soon as possible. 

###

 In the time we have left, Ambassador, as you know, there have been public and political furor over the expulsion of Ambassador U.S--- What do we know about the man who was detained?
 Well, John, it comes in at about $300 billion over the five-year length of the farm bill - big chunk of change, lots of money.--- But a lot of that goes to food stamps, doesn't it?--- How much of a kickback were you able to get to pass this along to your consumers and your farmers? --- Well, let's talk a little bit more about the farm bill. It's the largest farm bill in history. What does it look like?
 Well, that's been a serious issue raised by the mayor here. He feels that the money that he wants from the central government in Baghdad for reconstruction efforts has not flowed as freely as he had hoped. And if you drive around the city, you can see the evidence that mortars fell like rain here just a few months ago. There are many, many crumbled buildings, buildings that need to be rebuilt. The mayor says he's waiting for $33 million to come in that was promised to him by the Baghdad government that he has yet to see. So it's quite obvious that it's a city that seen a lot of bloodshed in the past, and hopefully what we've seen this weekend and early this week is not the start of a new trend here.--- Given the sectarian violence that you have seen in the last few days, are U.S. forces responding differently than they have been?--- 

###

 And just briefly, Michael, we know that this is a religiously mixed city. Are churches being used as shelters, and are priests and congregations praying for safety? --- Is there any sense of what's going on in Baghdad?
 That's right, yes, absolutely. It's a malignant form of cancer.--- And in this kind of tumor, is there an operation to cutting it out? Is that an option?--- 

###

 So, when it's - how do you diagnose a tremor at the beginning? I mean, how do you know this is something other than kind of just your everyday aging? --- And what's the treatment like for that?
 No, I don't get that far. I type in Falun Gong at Yahoo.com and a little pop-up comes up saying, Alert, the document contains no data.--- You don't even get the appearance of some information being turned up by the search?--- But for half the Yahoo! search engine, it does have those numbers of Falun Gong practitioners. So the numbers aren't disappearing under the surface of the net, they're only lacking in these little news systems. And I've been doing a recently project looking at Chinese numbers on the Internet, trying to see if you--- OK. So what does this mean for the people of the United States?
 You expect a machine like this to have problems, you know, growing pains as you get it to work operationally.--- Right. Question from Second Life from Rudy He asks, will it come back on line before power must be diverted to keep the cities there warm? Because it uses a lot of juice, doesn't it?--- But you don't expect it to have what essentially amounts to all of your data getting accidentally released into the public sphere. Did the NYPD, from the people I've talked to, alert Data Realms to the security problem, and were they concerned about it? --- And what's the problem with that?
 Yeah, we do. I think over the last 20 years we've taken in a huge number of people into the city. We have 50 different religions in the city. I mean, I'm sure that's the case of many other cities as well, but we've become a very diverse city, and that's enriched our culture.--- What sort of things do Bristol or you going to be able to try and help offer these refugees from Syria?--- 

###

 You've just been reelected. There's a new mayor, Bill de Blasio. He's a fellow Democrat. In his victory speech, he talked about giving voice to New York City's needs. In his first address to the City Council, he talked about simply getting to work. Did either--- What do you see as the future of the city? I mean, is it going to be more diverse, more diverse?
 Some of these boats, in particular, are in bad shape. And some of the men, in particular, are in bad shape. They have running sores. They have bedbug outbreaks. And some people are very afraid of their captains.--- What kind of fish are they catching? And who ultimately is buying it?--- 

###

 Have they gone hungry? --- Do you have any sense of how many people are on board these boats?
 That's...--- ...Ever since. So how serious a breach is this? I mean, how much damage might this do to the NSA as it's trying to continue doing its work?--- Wow, a comparison's being made in your article between Trump and Marcos, is that right? --- What's the significance of that?
 Yeah. Twenty-five percent more, yes.--- Tell us about the make up of this plane. Is it a metal skin or is it the composites we see on fighter planes now?--- And so at first, you can imagine the team is unfulfilled. Then, they start to talk about, we need to work together more constructively because they've been pretty dysfunctional up until now. I mean, I will just stop right here. And then, you write about making up. That's one of--- Twenty-five percent more?
 Not yet. He says he plans to fight the ruling. SCA is based in Dallas, and it's gone to state district court in Dallas to ask that the arbitration award be turned into a final judgment. If that happens within the next 30 to 60 days, then SCA can collect the money. If he still refuses, the company can seize money from bank account, stocks, cash, jewelry, his vacation home in Hawaii even.--- You mentioned Lance Armstrong plans to fight. Any comment from him or his attorneys?--- They can take that and use it to pay off Hayes if he owes the company that money. Now Hayes filed for bankruptcy last year as part of his attempt to reorganize. We reached out to a bankruptcy attorney for comment, and they said they didn't represent Hayes but that bankruptcy proceedings can be a tricky business. They--- OK. So SCA has said it's going to collect the money. What happens then?
 Ultimately, I think baby steps. One, just creating a coalition that is biblically based but also shares the compassion that Jesus displayed in the Scriptures, an individual who cares for the poor, who's concerned for the outcast and the marginalized but, at the same time, doesn't compromise his divinity in order to show compassion. I think what we often are asked to do is to make those things mutually exclusive.--- Are you going to vote in November?--- We have one standard we're asking people to live by and then we say that, in fact, we're going to allow these heretical, blasphemous views into our churches. Well, why are you using those churches? Why are you working with those churches? So, I think you can have those things without--- What do you hope to accomplish with this coalition?
 Oh, absolutely. Interestingly enough, you know, two of the safest cities in the United States are San Diego and El Paso, which are both border towns. In the '90s, you know, it was kind of chaotic along the San Diego border. Significant progress was made and it's now one of the more secure border crossing points that we have. And you've seen, I think, a lot of this violence and this illegal activity now moving to Arizona. So there are certainly some things that could be learned and I think Arizona can gain some additional measures.--- Do you think there's enough political motivation on Capitol Hill to address immigration reform anytime soon?--- 

###

 What's your sense on this? Do you think states like Arizona, California, Utah and New Mexico would benefit from the kind of automatic, pre-arrestilantro -Prison for Profit initiative that was passed in Illinois? --- What are some of the things that you would like to see Arizona do differently?
 Well, it's a good question. I mean, it does get to - are we giving people the kind of news that matters to them? Obviously, a lot of this conversation gets tangled up quite quickly in national politics and Trump and the election. And I don't think the Daily News story is about that. But one of the things I think we learned in that conversation is that a lot of the journalism that a lot of journalists were doing, which is about the sort of horse race of politics or the sort of process of politics wasn't really what people wanted to read. I mean, they wanted to read about taxes. They wanted to read about health care. They wanted to read about school policy. And those stories weren't being done. So I think there's some fault in a very broad way in terms of what people are writing about. But this is the case that we now have to engage in.--- What about all of the new digital news sites that seem to be popping up everywhere? Because it does feel like there are an awful lot of sources of news these days, and many of them are trying to be these hyper-local sources of information that are supposed to fill the void when local papers shut down. Are they not cutting it?--- I think that continues to motivate me on this project: Is this really informing people about the system of finance that affects them? And no one's written a story that's really done that alongside a deep dive into the real issues that affect the lives of Americans. 

###

 The market for this kind of thing--- Well, let's talk a little bit more about journalism. I mean, you've been covering the news for a long time. You've covered politics for years. And you've covered the news that's been going on for so long. What do you think is going on now?
 So certainly the longer this goes on, the greater the concerns that it could drag in more tribes and more men into this conflict and spread beyond that northern district of Hassiba(ph). There have been attempts at tribal mediation, which went rather wrong. Yesterday when the house of Sadek al-Ahmar, where the mediation was going on, came under attack and mortar fire left several of those tribal mediators - and they were prominent sheiks - injured, and reports that even that some of them have been killed.--- What is at stake in the region if this power struggle continues?--- 

###

 Did those tribal heads accept or decline the president's offer of a non-Muslim safe area? --- And what are some of the other issues that have been raised in this mediation?
 Twenty years ago, when I was a young professor about to teach a course on African-American fiction, I set about to find a forgotten or undiscovered classic by a woman writer. I wanted a book that would hold its own against such urban classics as "Invisible Man" or "Native Son," an older book that would complement the newer works by Toni Morrison and Alice Walker or the recently republished novels of Zora Neale Hurston. What I discovered was Ann Petry's magnificent 1946 novel "The Street". Described by some as an urban "To Kill a Mockingbird," minus any redemption and hope, "The Street" tells the story of Lutie Johnson and her 8-year-old son during the last years of the Second World War. Lutie is a young, hard-working single mother in urban America trying to get ahead in a world that ignores and exploits her. I saw her struggles and determination as both inspiring and doomed. In striving to provide for her son's future, she often ignored his immediate needs and fears. This book shook me so much that whenever I taught it in class, later that night I would slip into my sleeping sons' bedrooms to watch them and make silent promises. Even now, whenever I finish it, I calculate how old the main character's son would be and wonder what sort of life he had. I care deeply about these characters. They are real to me. This book creates a lot of discussion, often uncomfortable, in my literature classes. It makes us confront difficult questions about race and class. Who has access to the American Dream? Why do some characters make it but Lutie doesn't? Petry wants her readers to see the two sides of America, the gleaming and moneyed suburbs, where she herself was raised, and the struggles of black women in Harlem where she moved after her marriage. "The Street" is a book that raises passion in readers, and in me. It is as relevant today as when it was written in the 1940s. Particularly now, with the upcoming presidential election, it makes us think about what it was like to be a single mother raising a black son to believe he was worthy of all the best this country can offer. I can't think of a better place to start a national discussion about the audacity of hope than with this undiscovered classic, as fresh and moving now as the day it was published.--- Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina is a professor of literature at Dartmouth College. She is also the author of "Mr. and Mrs. Prince", how an extraordinary 18th century family moved out of slavery and into legend. For more great book recommendations, you can visit our Web site at npr.org/books. President Bush is on the last leg of his last trip to Europe. He's in London today talking with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown about the war in Iraq and Iran's nuclear program. The trip has all the trappings of a state visit; formal banquet, tea with the Queen, but long-time NPR White House correspondent Don Gonyea says this trip just feels different. Don, how?--- I hope you will join me.--- What do you mean by that?
 Thank you very much.--- You're the head of the U.S. delegation at six party talks on the North Korean nuclear program, and I wonder, first, we heard President Bush earlier today saying that the transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or to non-state enemies would be considered a grave threat. North Korea would be held fully accountable. What does that mean?--- That was Maressa Orzillo. She is an independent scholar and graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles, focusing on violence against women and the organization Project Scion.

 From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES. I'm Farai Chideya. Another presidential debate--- So, first of all, how did you get into this business?
 Hi.--- So it seems like there's not a lot of good news coming out of Rio these days. What's going on?--- So who would you say is the star of the faculty? I mean, you know, let's say that you are standing at the crosswalk, and you see a person crossing who you think has tremendous presence. Who do you say is your guy on the faculty? --- So let's talk a little bit about this case. What is it?
 There were 9,000 people. I've never seen so many bikes in one location. Just phenomenal.--- Nine thousand?--- Of course, we're talking about an event that some remember as it being very flat. Is it still uphill for the riders when they leave the podium on Monday? --- And how many bikes did you see?
 Well, it was helpful to me, and I had even more fun writing "Heat" than I had writing "Cold."--- Why? What's fun about heat that's not about cold?--- Yeah. It was kind of, you know, what was not so much appealing, and I think this is Moreland and Rees-Myers' view, in terms of the heat from African-American activists in the '80s certainly intruded into this case, and perhaps colored how the initial investigation was conducted--- Well, you know, you have a lot of different things going on in your life, but I'm going to ask you about one of them, which is that you have to write a lot about your own life. And I'm wondering, do you think that writing a book like "Fire and Fury
 Things have improved since the first early weeks when people didn't have toilets, when there wasn't any water. But things haven't significantly improved in recent months. Things are pretty much at a plateau. People are living in tents, they're living under tarps, they're living in just shacks that they constructed out of whatever they could pull together and a lot of people are just stuck at sort of that level. There are some organized camps which are somewhat better in that they're all the same type of tents - they're better tents, they're stronger - but then they were trying to evacuate one of those during this approaching hurricane because it was on a flood plain and there was concerns and that turned into complete chaos as some people wanted to be evacuated, some people felt it was a trick. So things remain incredibly tenuous for people. People feel incredibly vulnerable and there's a sense that things aren't moving forward, that they're just stuck in these camps and it's unclear when they're going to get out.--- Well, what are the signs of rebuilding in Haiti and Port-au-Prince specifically?--- 

###

 Yesterday the U.N. stopped estimating how many are in these refugee camps. What do you know? --- And what about the people who are staying in these shelters?
 Yes, yes.--- You requested an additional $7.5 billion in aid for the Virgin Islands. What efforts would that money go toward?--- And they - but, will they do anything with that information? --- What do you mean by that?
 Good morning.--- So just put this in perspective for us, this moment. What is the meaning of this verdict?--- Do you see this as a tipping point for Amazon? --- What do you make of the president's decision to pull troops out of Syria?
 Well, the thing that makes Nashville unique is the location of Bridgestone Arena - right in downtown in the middle of everything, next to Broadway where all the neon lights are, all the restaurants, everything. So imagine yourself walking down the street. You see these neon lights. You smell barbecue. You smell all these great foods coming (inaudible). You hear live music as you're walking into the arena. So just that alone helps paint the picture of how you can get excited go into this game. And then after the game, what makes it different, too, you're right there on the streets - all the bars, all the honky-tonks, all the live music, restaurants. During the game, intermissions - it's not just advertisements playing on a Megatron. You have live music. So you have guys like Charles Esten from Nashville playing live music there. Sometimes you'll have people from different major bands, as well. You have country music stars singing the national anthem. It is a totally unique experience in every single way.--- As we said, Nashville's only had an NHL team for 18 years. Was it an easy transfer to move all the enthusiasm for all the other sports that Tennessee has to hockey or has it been an evolution over time?--- 

###

 So what is the feeling amongst the Nashville Predators players about, well, their opponents and especially about the fans? --- So what do you think is going to be the big takeaway from this game?
 This, until the completion of the investigation of the unfortunate event yesterday in Qana.--- Although then, that sounds like no suspension at all, because has the air campaign so far not been about getting to Hezbollah? Surely you're not intentionally targeting civilians, so what's the difference?--- We ask you to put that aside now and only think about the urgent humanitarian situation that is preoccupying everybody else besides just the government. And that relief efforts to continuing even though the roads are cut and destroyed. But, yes, we have relief organizations here. They're trying to get shipments. They're trying to--- And what are you going to do?
 Well, if you read Ted Turner's vision--and he's now really no longer involved in the running of CNN--but if you read what he had to say back when it was launched, he sort of described it as a newspaper of the air. He said, `You know, broadcast networks are really too much like headline wire service copy.' In a sense, that's what much of the time cable news functions as. They give you brief bursts of updates. In fact, MSNBC now every 15 minutes gives you an update of the news. And in between they're trying to figure out ways to keep you watching. So they'll do reported pieces. They'll do a lot of interviews. There are a lot of talk shows. And to be honest, there's a lot of things that we would classify as kind of pulpy, quasi-tabloid, quasi-celebrity news; anything that's sort of waiting for the next great crisis. And when crisis hits, people turn to cable, they particularly turn to CNN. And when crisis abates, they kind of tune it out. They don't need it as much.--- What do you think, then, that cable news has contributed to journalism?--- And what comes after that is going to be critical. How do you introduce a new generation of viewers as well as a new generation of reporters? 

###

 Have you guys figured that part out? Or do you need to? Is there a model out there that you could use? --- And what about cable news? I mean, there's been a lot of criticism of the cable news industry for not doing its job. What's been the reaction to that?
 And they don't.--- One final thing. You have spoken favorably of Donald Trump, who has said that he believes a lot of other politicians are bought and paid for and further says that, as a billionaire, as he says he is, that he bought and paid for a lot of them. Is he right?--- 

###

 I assume you have student loan payments. Can you just not pay those? --- They don't?
 Good.--- There are obvious perils with Elizabeth Gilbert's "Eat Pray Love." The circumstances are kind of similar, obviously, with the divorce and - but she took a trip around the world and you write: I just moved off the porch and went again to church. And you do go to church, even when you absolutely don't want to. Why'd you do it?--- And we have to keep a lookout for cases of vaccine-preventable illness, you know? So better safe than sorry, and you know, particularly in the summertime where the weather's hotter, and I think that's very critical. 

###

 You've been very thoughtful and pragmatic about this.--- So let's start with the big picture. The U.S. and China have been trading tariffs for a while now. What's going on?
 Well, it's actually very significant. The Hispanic vote in Florida in a primary can be 10 to 12 percent of that vote. And as we saw in the 2004 Republican primary when Mel Martinez won the nomination, a very high turn-out in Miami-Dade where the vote moved in a large direction towards one candidate, it can be very telling and very important to building a vote margin.--- Well, you've been a consultant to candidates in Florida. So, I want you to give away a little bit of it for free right now. If you were consulting with Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich and you had a simple message to convey to each of them, what would it be?--- 

###

 How do those 42 delegates divide up, though, between the two Floridas? How does a state like Florida decide how many of those delegates it's earmarking? --- What about the Hispanic vote? What do you see as the most important battleground states in this election?
 Well, you know, officials say that Rahman was killed last week in Waziristan, Pakistan in this CIA drone strike, and they seem fairly confident that they got him. That said, you know, there are often reports about drone strikes against core al-Qaida leaders and then these guys end up surfacing later. And in fact, that actually happened to Rahman last year. They said he was dead and clearly he wasn't. And he was reported killed this time in a very remote part of Pakistan. So, it's unclear how the U.S. can be so sure they got him. The officials we spoke to seemed pretty confident but they wouldn't say whether they had DNA evidence or something more dispositive like that. Usually, the way we find out definitively is al-Qaida announces it, and that hasn't happened yet.--- So, if they do have him or if they did kill him, what does it mean for al-Qaida?--- 

###

 And is there any evidence that al-Qaida is weakened at all by these deaths? --- So, what do we know about the circumstances in which he was killed?
 That's exactly right. There's deep fear about this crisis spreading to Italy and expanding further. There are reports this morning, Renee, that Italy has agreed to let the International Monetary Fund monitor its economic reform efforts. Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has been under intense pressure to move very quickly on really a broad series of reforms, including very controversial issues, such as privatizing state-run Italian companies, radically reforming the government pension system, labor market changes to make it easier to fire workers. You know, these are all measures that are deeply unpopular at home. And Berlusconi, like his Greek colleague, is under mounting pressure to step down and hand power to an emergency government. Italy's government is in crisis. And really the whole issue of expanding the eurozone's rescue firewall is to try to better protect against the possibility that Italy's troubles will only get worse in coming months.--- The G-20 meeting wraps up today. What will world leaders there have to show for it?--- Renee, where is the Spanish government? Is it possible they're equally as bad off as Italy, or are there perhaps some divisions within that government, as well? --- And what about the eurozone? I mean, there's been a lot of talk about how the eurozone is going to deal with this. Is that going to help?
 Basically, she prayed for the university. She prayed for the students' continued success. She prayed over the losses that we've all experienced. And she prayed basically just for the preservation of our university and for our students to continue to do well.--- Regina, what did you do in the months that you couldn't go back to Xavier after Katrina hit?--- 

###

 You guys have been together for a long time - 13 years, I believe. And I wondered if this is - if she is - I don't want to use the word inspiration - but if Sarahah has been a real source of comfort for you both as a couple and as individuals? --- What do you think she meant by that?
 Thank you.--- So the Saudi crown has typically been passed from one elderly brother to another elderly brother, all sons of the country's founder. Now they're going to the grandsons of the founder. What do we know about the new heirs apparent?--- You're welcome.

 Morgan Tsvangarai was the opposition candidate in the recent election in the Congo. He is currently president of the Movement for Democratic Change. Just ahead, stock markets continue their crazy roller coaster ride. The Nasdaq fell almost nine points this morning. We'll catch up--- So, first of all, how did you get into this business?
 Good, thanks.--- Why do you want to capture light and delay it sort of in a bottle, in a crystal bottle, for lack of a better term, for, like, a second or more?--- And he's just a few years older than I am. And he was my advisor on a year abroad program in England. And when I came back, we started seeing each other a little, and we were friends. But you didn't try to have sex with him. So again, it was never awkward. It--- So let's start with this. You've been reporting on this for a couple of weeks now. What's the latest?
 Well, I'm fine, of course, it's an awkward position to expect philosophy to answer a question once and for all. I mean if we could answer questions once for all, we would be out of business once we turn the answers in. If I'm to be guide toward good decision making, I fear that many will be, not only frustrated at the end, but confirmed in their suspicion that philosophy's limits are nerve racking.--- Well, we'll take that risk today and ask you where you might start when you're picking say, a philosopher to start with. Which ones of those might we go to for moral decisions?--- And you have teams of ethicists appointed by courts to rule on what dying patients have the right to know. Rod Nordland, a science reporter at the New York Times wrote a report this week on artificial intelligence military arms and present is that arms will get more lethal as their brains hardware gets more lifelike. How--- Well, let's talk a little bit more about philosophy. What do you mean by that?
