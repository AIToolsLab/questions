# Trained Models

This directory contains all code used for training models.

Fine-tuning scripts were taken from the HuggingFace Transformers repository (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch).

Due to file size limitations on GitHub, the following directories were ignored when pushing to Git:
- /model, the directory containing the trained model
- /log, the directory containing output logs and error messages for the trained models
- /wandb, the Weights & Biases logging
- /data, the directory containing the training and validation sets used to fine-tune the model
