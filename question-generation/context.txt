Well, I was born in South Africa, lived there until I was 17. Came to North America of my own accord, against my parentâ€™s wishes. And was in Canada for a few years. I started school there which is where I met my wife. Transferred down to the University of Pennsylvania and got a degree in physics, degree in business at Wharton. Came out to California with the intent of doing a PHD in the material science and physics [unintelligible] with an eye towards using that as an energy storage unit for electric vehicles. I ended up deferring that graduate work to start a couple to start a couple of area companies, one of which people have heard about, such as Pay Pal.
