# InterviewAI

With the advent of machine learning, it has become increasingly clear that AI is capable of completing tasks that were hitherto considered only possible by human minds. We are now pushing the boundaries of what AI can do with natural language processing (NLP), from summarizing pages of text to keeping up a conversation with a human. Our project aims to join those on the frontier of machine learning by creating an AI Interviewer. There are two main problems to address here: first, whether creating such an interviewer will be possible, and second, whether it will be any good.
